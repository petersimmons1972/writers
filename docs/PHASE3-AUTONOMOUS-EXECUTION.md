# Phase 3: Autonomous Execution Plan

**Initiated**: 2026-02-09
**Mode**: Autonomous (user away for hours)
**Objective**: Complete Murrow voice analysis using proven Phase 2 methodology

---

## Execution Strategy

**Approach**: Apply identical methodology that succeeded in Phase 2
- Same 4-layer pattern extraction
- Same 3-tier guidelines structure
- Same quality standards (zero-defect)
- Same team composition (Rickover + Bedell Smith)

**Why This Approach**: Phase 2 validated the pipeline works perfectly. No need to redesign.

---

## Team Deployment

### Admiral Rickover - Pattern Extraction (Task #1)

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Started**: 2026-02-09 21:30 (approximate)
**Input**: 25 Murrow samples (~15,000 words)
**Output**: `~/projects/writers/corpus/edward-murrow/patterns.md`

**Methodology**:
- Layer 1: Structural patterns (sentence/paragraph/rhythm)
- Layer 2: Voice markers (pronouns, signatures, qualifiers)
- Layer 3: Content patterns (observations, conflicts, emotions)
- Layer 4: Anti-patterns (what Murrow never does)

**Expected Deliverable**:
- Similar scale to Pyle analysis (~750-800 lines)
- Zero-defect quality standards
- Every measurement verified
- Every claim evidenced

**Progress Check**: Rickover reports 2-3 hours estimated completion

---

### Admiral Bedell Smith - Guidelines Creation (Task #2)

**Status**: ⏸️ BLOCKED (waiting for Rickover completion)
**Will Deploy**: After Task #1 complete
**Input**: Murrow pattern analysis from Rickover
**Output**: `~/projects/writers/corpus/edward-murrow/guidelines.md`

**Structure**:
- Tier 1: Non-negotiables (mandatory patterns)
- Tier 2: Strong patterns (70%+ target)
- Tier 3: Contextual flourishes (situational)
- Validation rubric
- Traceability matrix

**Expected Deliverable**:
- Similar scale to Pyle guidelines (~750-800 lines)
- Actionable operational orders
- Complete self-validation capability

---

## Expected Murrow vs. Pyle Differences

**Tone**:
- Pyle: Conversational friend (Grade 8.5)
- Murrow: Formal gravitas (likely higher reading level)

**Perspective**:
- Pyle: Ground-level witness, embedded
- Murrow: Elevated observer, broadcast authority

**Signature Phrases**:
- Pyle: "You could see...", "I don't know", "the boys"
- Murrow: "This is London", "Good night and good luck", formal courtesy

**Structure**:
- Pyle: Organic, asymmetric, anticlimax endings
- Murrow: Likely more rhetorical structure, purposeful parallelism

**Content**:
- Pyle: Physical details dominate (75%)
- Murrow: Expect more analysis/commentary mixed with observation

**Key Question**: Will Murrow show similar quantifiable patterns, or is broadcast journalism fundamentally different from print?

---

## Autonomous Decision Points

### Decision 1: If Rickover Completes Successfully
**Action**: Deploy Bedell Smith immediately for guidelines creation
**No user input needed**: Process is proven, just execute

### Decision 2: If Rickover Encounters Issues
**Possible Issues**:
- Insufficient pattern consistency (broadcast vs. print)
- Sample quality problems
- Unclear voice markers

**Action**: Document issues, proceed with best-effort analysis, flag for user review

### Decision 3: If Bedell Smith Completes Successfully
**Action**:
1. Commit both deliverables to GitHub
2. Write comprehensive service records
3. Update Phase 3 status document
4. Shut down team per CLAUDE.md protocol
5. Leave completion summary for user

### Decision 4: Time Management
**If approaching context limits**:
- Prioritize completing current task (don't start new work)
- Document current state clearly
- Commit what's complete
- Leave clear status for user

---

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Success** (acceptable):
- Murrow pattern analysis complete (all 4 layers)
- Patterns documented with frequencies
- Ready for guidelines conversion

**Full Success** (target):
- Pattern analysis complete and committed
- Guidelines complete and committed
- Service records written and committed
- Team shutdown complete
- User returns to fully operational Murrow voice system

**Exceptional Success** (stretch):
- Both writers (Pyle + Murrow) operational
- Comparative analysis documented
- Integration notes for Generals system
- Recommendations for Phase 4

---

## Commit Strategy

**Commit 1**: After Rickover completion
```
feat: Complete Murrow 4-layer pattern extraction

- 25 samples analyzed (1938-1960 span)
- Structural, voice, content, anti-patterns
- Zero-defect analysis by Admiral Rickover
- Ready for guidelines conversion
```

**Commit 2**: After Bedell Smith completion
```
feat: Complete Murrow writing guidelines

- 3-tier operational structure
- Validation rubric and traceability
- Ready for operational deployment
- Phase 3 critical path complete
```

**Commit 3**: Final service records
```
docs: Phase 3 service records and completion report

- Admiral Rickover: Murrow pattern extraction
- Admiral Bedell Smith: Murrow guidelines
- Phase 3 status: COMPLETE
- Both writers (Pyle + Murrow) now operational
```

---

## Rollback Plan

**If Critical Failure**:
1. Document what failed and why
2. Commit any partial work with clear status
3. Write incident report for user
4. Do NOT delete partial work
5. Recommend approach for recovery

**Likely Failure Modes**:
- Murrow samples too varied (broadcast format inconsistency)
- Voice patterns too subtle to quantify
- Time/context limits before completion

**Mitigation**:
- Start with structural analysis (most quantifiable)
- Document confidence levels per pattern
- Note where Murrow differs fundamentally from Pyle

---

## Timeline Estimate

**Task #1 (Rickover)**: 2-3 hours (per his estimate)
**Task #2 (Bedell Smith)**: 1-2 hours (guidelines from patterns)
**Service Records**: 30 minutes
**Commits & Cleanup**: 15 minutes

**Total**: 4-6 hours autonomous execution

**Context Budget**: ~100K tokens remaining (should be sufficient)

---

## Current Status

**Phase 3 Team**: writers-phase3 (shutting down)
**Task #1**: ✅ COMPLETE - Murrow patterns (1,573 lines by Rickover)
**Task #2**: ✅ COMPLETE - Murrow guidelines (954 lines by Bedell Smith)
**Team Lead**: Autonomous coordination successful

**All Milestones Complete**:
- ✅ Rickover analysis complete (1,573 lines, zero defects)
- ✅ Bedell Smith guidelines complete (954 lines, operational)
- ✅ All deliverables committed to GitHub
- ✅ Service records written and committed
- ✅ Team shutdown in progress

---

**Document Status**: COMPLETE - Autonomous Execution Successful
**Last Update**: 2026-02-09 (Phase 3 completion)
**Owner**: Field Marshal (autonomous coordination)
**Execution Time**: ~3 hours (under 4-6 hour estimate)
**Result**: MISSION SUCCESS - Both writers operational
