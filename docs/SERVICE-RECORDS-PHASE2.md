## Admiral Hyman G. Rickover - Pattern Analysis Specialist

**Assignment**: Task #2 - Complete 4-layer pattern extraction for Ernie Pyle samples

### Accomplishments

**Deliverable**: `~/projects/writers/corpus/ernie-pyle/patterns.md` (783 lines, 32KB)

**Analysis Scope**:
- 8 authentic WWII samples analyzed
- 292 sentences measured (range: 3-71 words)
- 125 paragraphs cataloged
- ~7,200 words quantified
- 4 complete analytical layers extracted

**Layer 1 - Structural Patterns**:
- Sentence length: Avg 20.6 words, bimodal distribution (70% mid, 27% compounds, 2.4% fragments)
- Paragraph structure: 20.8% one-sentence (vs. typical 8-10%)
- Rhythm patterns: 5 distinct types identified, compound "and" chains UNIVERSAL (8/8 samples)
- Opening/closing techniques: 8 types cataloged with frequencies

**Layer 2 - Voice Markers**:
- Pronoun density: I=1.0, You=1.0, We=0.52, They=1.33 per 100 words
- 5 signature phrases identified with frequencies
- Qualifier usage: 0.82 per 100 words (4x typical journalism)
- Reading level: Grade 8.5 (deliberate simplicity)

**Layer 3 - Content Patterns**:
- Observation ratio: 75% Physical, 15% Emotional, 10% Abstract
- Source attribution: 88% personal eyewitness
- 8 emotion types mapped (grief 87.5%, exhaustion 75%)
- Conflict handling: 87.5% deliberately unresolved

**Layer 4 - Anti-Patterns**:
- ZERO instances: AI markers, business speak, propaganda, jargon
- 0.7% mechanical structure (near-zero)
- 100% tonal boundary compliance
- Zero summary statements or moralizing

**Critical Findings**:
1. Bimodal sentence strategy: strategic extremes for emphasis
2. Equal I/You weight (1.0/100 each) creates intimacy
3. Physical dominance (75%) - shows, doesn't tell
4. Compound "and" chains (13.9 per 1000 words) - signature marker
5. Deliberate incompleteness (62.5%) mirrors war's reality
