# Joan Didion: Writing Samples and Style Analysis

## Overview

Joan Didion (1934-2021) was an American writer and journalist, considered a pioneer of New Journalism and one of the most influential essayists of the 20th century. She wrote for major publications including Vogue, The Saturday Evening Post, The New York Review of Books, and The New Yorker.

Didion's signature was her "cool, detached" prose style marked by precision, brevity, and unflinching honesty. She used short declarative sentences, integrated herself into her reporting, and documented American culture with sharp observational clarity. Her work combined personal narrative with incisive cultural analysis.

## Sample 1: "On Self-Respect" (1961)

**Publication:** Vogue, 1961 | **Collection:** *Slouching Towards Bethlehem* (1968) | **Genre:** Personal essay

### Key Passages

**Opening (Famous line):**
> "Once, in a dry season, I wrote in large letters across two pages of a notebook that innocence ends when one is stripped of the delusion that one likes oneself."

**On Character:**
> "Character—the willingness to accept responsibility for one's own life—is the source from which self-respect springs."

> "People with self-respect have the courage of their mistakes. They know the price of things. If they choose to commit adultery, they do not then go running, in an access of bad conscience, to receive absolution from the wronged parties; nor do they complain unduly of the unfairness, the undeserved embarrassment, of being named co-respondent."

**On the Inner Life:**
> "Self-respect has nothing to do with the approval of others—who are, after all, deceived easily enough; has nothing to do with reputation, which, as Rhett Butler told Scarlett O'Hara, is something people with courage can do without."

> "To have that sense of one's intrinsic worth which constitutes self-respect is potentially to have everything: the ability to discriminate, to love and to remain indifferent. To lack it is to be locked within oneself, paradoxically incapable of either love or indifference."

**Concrete Example:**
> "I lost some

confidence after failing to be elected to Phi Beta Kappa in my junior year at Berkeley. At that moment I lost the conviction that lights had turned green for me, that lights would always turn green for me."

### Style Analysis

- **Opening technique**: Begins with concrete personal moment before expanding to universal truth
- **Sentence structure**: Mix of short declarative statements and longer compound sentences with precise grammatical control
- **Tone**: Detached yet personal; analytical without being cold
- **Key device**: Uses specific examples (Phi Beta Kappa failure, adultery scenario) to ground abstract concepts
- **Emotional register**: Restrained, intellectual, honest without sentimentality
- **Grammar consciousness**: "To have that sense... is potentially to have everything: the ability..." - infinitive structure carries philosophical weight

## Sample 2: "Goodbye to All That" (1967)

**Publication:** *Slouching Towards Bethlehem* (1968) | **Subject:** New York City | **Genre:** Memoir essay

### Key Passages

**Opening:**
> "How long was I in New York? Five years. It was a long time. Or a short time, depending on your point of view. It was a time when I was very young, twenty to twenty-five, and I loved the city the way you love the first person who ever touches you and never love anyone quite that way again."

**On Arrival:**
> "I was twenty. I came from Sacramento. I had never been to New York before, and I did not know anyone there. But I wanted to go there and wanted it very badly."

**Signature Observation:**
> "It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends. I can remember now, with a clarity that makes the nerves in the back of my neck constrict, when New York began for me, but I cannot lay my finger upon the moment it ended, can never cut through the ambiguities and second starts and broken resolves to the exact place on the page where the heroine is no longer as optimistic as she once was."

**Sensory Detail:**
> "I remember walking across Sixty-second Street one twilight that first spring, or the second spring, they were all alike for a while. I was late to meet someone but I stopped at Lexington Avenue and bought a peach and stood on the corner eating it and knew that I had come out of the West and reached the mirage."

**On Leaving:**
> "New York was no mere city. It was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself. To think of 'living' there was to reduce the miraculous to the mundane; one does not 'live' at Xanadu."

### Style Analysis

- **Structure**: Non-linear; circles around the theme rather than chronological progression
- **Temporal ambiguity**: "the first spring, or the second spring, they were all alike" - deliberate vagueness about time
- **Metaphor**: New York as "mirage," "Xanadu," "perishable dream" - romantic but also illusory
- **Sentence rhythm**: Long, flowing sentences punctuated by short declarative statements
- **Self-awareness**: "the heroine is no longer as optimistic" - third-person distance from her own experience
- **Physical anchors**: Peach on Lexington Avenue - concrete sensory moment crystallizes abstract feeling

## Sample 3: "Why I Write" (1976)

**Publication:** The New York Times Book Review, 1976 | **Collection:** *Let Me Tell You What I Mean* (2021) | **Genre:** Craft essay

### Key Passages

**Opening:**
> "Of course I stole the title for this talk, from George Orwell. One reason I stole it was that I like the sound of the words: Why I Write. There you have three short unambiguous words that share a sound, and the sound they share is this: I, I, I. In many ways writing is the act of saying I, of imposing oneself upon other people, of saying listen to me, see it my way, change your mind."

**On Process:**
> "I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear."

> "Had I been blessed with even limited access to my own mind there would have been no reason to write. I write entirely to find out what's on my mind."

**On Grammar:**
> "To shift the structure of a sentence alters the meaning of that sentence, as definitely and inflexibly as the position of a camera alters the meaning of the object photographed."

**On Images:**
> "Let me show you what I mean by pictures in the mind. I began Play It As It Lays just as I have begun each of my novels, with no notion of 'character' or 'plot' or even 'incident.' I had only two pictures in my mind, more about which later, and a technical intention, which was to write a novel so elliptical and fast that it would be over before you noticed it, a novel so fast that it would scarcely exist on the page at all."

### Style Analysis

- **Meta-awareness**: Essay about writing reveals her writing process
- **Honesty**: "I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking" - admits not knowing beforehand
- **Grammar obsession**: Sentence structure equals meaning - technical precision matters
- **Process revelation**: Starts with images, not plot or character - visual thinker
- **Aggressive framing**: "act of saying I, of imposing oneself" - unflinching about writer's ego
- **Technical language**: "elliptical," "technical intention" - architect's vocabulary

## Sample 4: "The Women's Movement" (1972)

**Publication:** The New York Times, 1972 | **Collection:** *The White Album* (1979) | **Genre:** Cultural criticism

### Key Passages

**Opening observation:**
> "To make an omelette you need not only those broken eggs but someone 'oppressed' to break them."

**On Rhetoric:**
> "The astral discontent with actual lives, actual men, the denial of the real generative possibilities of adult sexual life somehow touches beyond words."

**Critique:**
> "That many women are victims of condescension and exploitation and sex-role stereotyping was scarcely news, but neither was it news that other women are not: nobody forces women to buy the package."

### Style Analysis

- **Opening device**: Begins with provocative aphorism
- **Contrarian stance**: Willing to critique progressive movements
- **Precision**: "astral discontent" - exact word choice for vague dissatisfaction
- **Both-sides clarity**: Acknowledges sexism while critiquing feminist rhetoric
- **No sentimentality**: Refuses to romanticize either position

## Sample 5: "On Morality" (1965)

**Publication:** The American Scholar, 1965 | **Collection:** *Slouching Towards Bethlehem* (1968) | **Genre:** Philosophical essay

### Key Passages

**Setting:**
> "As it happens I am in Death Valley, in a room at the Enterprise Motel and Trailer Park, and it is July, and it is hot. In fact it is 119°. I cannot seem to make the air conditioner work, but there is a small refrigerator, and I can wrap ice cubes in a towel and hold them against the small of my back."

**Central argument:**
> "You see I want to be quite obstinate about insisting that we have no way of knowing—beyond that fundamental loyalty to the social code—what is 'right' and what is 'wrong,' what is 'good' and what is 'evil.'"

**Wagon-train morality:**
> "Every now and then someone mentions 'morality,' and everyone feels bound to have something to say. How many madmen have said it and meant it? How many murderers? Klaus Fuchs and Alfred Rosenberg, who thought themselves martyrs?"

**The nurse story:**
> "A nurse in a particularly disturbing case had appeared to tell me that her husband who had stayed with the body of a dead man. She wanted me to know that she and her husband had been very deeply affected by this and had asked me if there was anything in their religion that would help them. At the time I was as unable to help them as I am now."

### Style Analysis

- **Concrete opening**: Establishes physical environment before philosophical discussion
- **Personal intrusion**: "As it happens I am..." - places herself in the scene
- **Distrust of abstractions**: Prefers specific examples (nurse, dead body) to general principles
- **Questioning tone**: "How many madmen have said it and meant it?"
- **Wagon-train ethics**: Reduces morality to basic social code, not grand principles

## Sample 6: "Holy Water" (1977)

**Publication:** *The White Album* (1979) | **Subject:** California water systems | **Genre:** Personal essay

### Key Passages

**Opening obsession:**
> "Some of us who live in arid parts of the world think about water with a reverence others might find excessive."

**Technical fascination:**
> "I have always wanted a swimming pool, and never had one. It doesn't have anything to do with actual swimming: I can swim in the ocean. What it has to do with is water. Simply to have that much water, to have it

 standing there, clear and blue in the sun — it is not unlike the sensations people have about money in the bank. It is a defense against chaos."

**The Operations Control Center:**
> "All that water, forever changing places under those cloudless skies. Evaporate here, condense there, go up, come down. A perfect three-billion-dollar hydraulic toy to drain that immense pool of standing water, the snowpack in the Sierras."

**On California identity:**
> "As Bernard DeVoto knew, in the West there is no such thing as a private 'water right.' Water is a public resource, always has been."

### Style Analysis

- **Personal confession**: "I have always wanted a swimming pool" - admits obsession
- **Technical detail**: Specific hydraulic terminology mixed with lyrical description
- **Water = control**: Swimming pools as "defense against chaos"
- **Regional identity**: Water defines Western consciousness
- **Lyrical precision**: "clear and blue in the sun" - simple but exact
