# Orwell Test #1 Scoring (Multi-Agent AI Systems)

**Test Date**: 2026-02-10
**Word Count**: 768 words
**Scorer**: Self-validation against guidelines rubric
**Target**: 80+ points for operational status

---

## Tier 1: Non-Negotiables (40 points total)

### Rule 1: Concrete → Abstract Escalation (5 points)

**Evidence Present:**
- ✅ Opens concrete: "I sat in a windowless room watching code execute on twelve monitors"
- ✅ Physical observation: "Each screen showed a different agent", "One agent bid for compute resources"
- ✅ Builds to abstract: "automated organizational dysfunction", "blame diffusion"
- ✅ Political generalization: "Multi-agent systems do not make this problem worse—they simply make it faster"

**Pattern**: Physical observation (code on monitors) → Personal realization (nobody knows what happens next) → Systemic analysis (automated blame diffusion)

**Concrete noun sample**: room, monitors, agent, code, engineers, screen, resources, documentation, database  
**Abstract noun sample**: behavior, system, responsibility, accountability

**Score**: ✅ **5/5** (Clear concrete → abstract escalation throughout)

---

### Rule 2: Self-Incriminating Honesty (5 points)

**Evidence Present:**
- ✅ Paragraph 1: "I understood perhaps a tenth of what I was watching" (admits ignorance)
- ✅ Paragraph 3: "I will admit my bias at once: I came to this observation with a suspicion..." (preemptive admission of bias)
- ✅ Paragraph 9: "The engineers who built this system are not malicious. They are skilled, thoughtful, and genuinely excited" (refuses to position self as moral superior)

**Forbidden personas avoided:**
- ❌ No hero ("I bravely...") 
- ❌ No victim ("As someone harmed...")
- ❌ No neutral observer ("I have no opinion...")

**Score**: ✅ **5/5** (Self-incriminating admissions in first 3 paragraphs)

---

### Rule 3: Active Voice Dominance (5 points)

**Sample verb analysis (first 100 verbs):**

**Active voice examples:**
- "I sat" / "I watched" / "I understood" / "I asked"
- "agents coordinate" / "engineers explained" / "system crashed"
- "companies avoid" / "agents follow"

**Passive voice instances:**
- "they call them agents" (acceptable - emphasizing naming convention)
- "who built this system" (active in subordinate clause)

**Estimated ratio**: 90%+ active voice

**Score**: ✅ **5/5** (Dominantly active voice throughout)

---
