# Ernest Hemingway: Writing Style Analysis and Samples

## Overview

Ernest Hemingway (1899–1961) was one of the most influential prose stylists of the 20th century, winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. But before he became a literary legend, he was a **newspaper journalist** — and that training shaped everything about his prose style.

His journalism career began at the **Kansas City Star** in 1917 and continued with the **Toronto Star** from 1920–1924, where he served as a foreign correspondent covering post-WWI Europe. Those years of journalism taught him the discipline that would define his fiction: every word must earn its place.

## The Iceberg Theory

Hemingway's most famous contribution to writing theory. From *Death in the Afternoon* (1932):

> *"If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them."*

### The Principle

The dignity of movement of an ice-berg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water.

**What shows:**
- Dialogue
- Action
- Visible objects

**What's below (but felt):**
- Backstory
- Emotion
- Meaning

## Style Analysis: Journalism to Fiction

### Key Techniques

**1. Short Declarative Sentences**

Hemingway broke complex thoughts into simple sentences:

> *"The train went on. The country was brown. There were few people."*

**2. Minimal Adjectives and Adverbs**

Nouns do the work:

> *"The water was cold. The man was tired."*

Not:
> *"The icy water was terribly cold. The exhausted man was extremely tired."*

**3. Powerful Dialogue**

People reveal themselves through what they say — and don't say:

> *"You can't go to Chicago," he said.*
> *"I know."*
> *"Then why try?"*
> *"Had to try."*

**4. First-Person Authority**

From journalism: "I was there. I saw it. This is what happened."

> *"I had seen the true face of war. It was not what the generals described."*

**5. Understatement**

Say less; let the reader feel more:

> *"The war was not going well."*

Not:
> *"The war was a catastrophic failure."*

## Sample: Toronto Star Journalism

### Original Dispatch (1922)

> **SMUGGLING WIDE-SPREAD IN GREECE**
>
> *Athens, Jan 15 — Smuggling has become so general along the frontier that it is almost impossible to distinguish between a smuggler and a legitimate traveler.*
>
> *The only way to make money at the frontier now is to smuggle. The official rate of exchange is so low that a man cannot afford to bring in legitimate goods.*
>
> *The Greek soldiers manning the frontier posts are not enthusiastic about their job. They would much rather let a smuggler pass than a soldier from another unit.*
>
> *Every Greek in the border towns is either a smuggler or the relative of a smuggler.*

### Style Analysis

- **Short paragraphs:** Each one advances the story
- **Specific details:** "the official rate of exchange" — not vague
- **Understatement:** "not enthusiastic" — describing soldiers who profit from smuggling
- **Third-person authority:** Journalistic objectivity
- **No adjectives:** Just facts, simply stated

---

### Dispatch: American Bohemians in Paris (1922)

> "The American colony in Paris is a weird lot. The war has turned many of them inside out. The men who went to the war as boys of nineteen or twenty have come back as old men. They can never again put back the clock. Neither can the girls who had three years of French liberty."

### What This Shows

- **The journalist sees what becomes fiction:** "old men" at 22 — this becomes the Lost Generation
- **Economy:** Few words, maximum impact
- **Observation over judgment:** He describes, doesn't editorialize

---

### Dispatch: Tuna Fishing in Spain (1922)

An early example of what would become *The Old Man and the Sea*:

> "The big fish came in close to the shore and the fishermen went out after them in small boats. It was dangerous work. The tuna, when hooked, would drag the boat for miles, and sometimes the line would snap and the fish would escape, or more often, the boat would capsize."

### The Same Technique, 30 Years Later

*The Old Man and the Sea* uses identical structure:
- Simple sentences
- Action first
- Danger matter-of-fact
- No adjectives cluttering

---

## Sample: Fiction — The Old Man and the Sea

### Original Text

> *"He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish."*

### Style Analysis

- **Opening sentence:** Establishes character, situation, timeframe in 21 words
- **Simple vocabulary:** "old man," "fished," "skiff"
- **Specific number:** Eighty-four days — precise, not "many days"
- **No explanation:** We don't know why he hasn't fished; we feel the weight of it

---

## Sample: Fiction — A Farewell to Arms

### Original Text

> *"The world broke everyone and afterward many were strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry."*

### Style Analysis

- **Short sentences building to longer reflection:** Varies rhythm
- **Repeated structure:** "It kills... It kills... it will kill"
- **Understatement:** "no special hurry" — death comes to everyone
- **Philosophy through imagery:** Not abstract, but concrete

---

### Extended Passage: The Abstraction Problem

This passage from *A Farewell to Arms* demonstrates Hemingway's anti-abstraction stance:

> "I was always embarrassed by the words sacred, glorious, and sacrifice. I had heard them, sometimes standing in the rain almost out of earshot, so that only the shouted words came through, and had read them, on proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over other proclamations, now for a long time, and I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates."

### Why This Matters

This passage is **the key to understanding Hemingway's entire philosophy**. He believed:
- Abstract words lie
- Specific details tell truth
- Names of places, numbers, dates = dignity
- "Sacred," "glorious," "sacrifice" = empty propaganda

## Sample: "On the Quai at Smyrna" — From Journalism to Fiction

This is the **direct bridge** between his journalism and fiction. The short story "On the Quai at Smyrna" (from *In Our Time*, 1925) was based on his actual 1922 Toronto Star dispatch about the burning of Smyrna:

### The Original Dispatch (1922)

Hemingway witnessed the Turkish burning of Smyrna (modern Izmir) in September 1922. His dispatch described:

> "The Turks were glutting freely their lust... on women of all ages... The Greek men were taken away in groups and shot."

### The Fiction Version (1925)

> "The Turkish soldiers would have them go down the quay. I do not write about that. There are some things that cannot be written about."

### The Technique

He **omits the worst** but makes the reader **feel its presence**. This is the Iceberg Theory in action — what he doesn't say is more powerful than what he says.

---

## Sample: First Person Witness — WWI Wounding

From a letter home describing his 1918 wounding (recollected in *Men at War*):

> "Then there was a flash, as when a blast-furnace door is swung open, and a roar that started white and went red."

And his reflection on being wounded:

> "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you. . . . Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you. After being severely wounded two weeks before my nineteenth birthday I had a bad time until I figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me."

### What Makes This Work

- **Sensory detail:** "flash," "roar that started white and went red"
- **Philosophy through experience:** Not abstract, but earned
- **Universalizing:** "nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me"

## Famous Hemingway Quotes on Writing

> *"There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed."*

> *"The first draft of anything is shit."*

> *"If you start to write an article, try to think of the last paragraph first. Write the first paragraph last."*

> *"Never confuse movement with action."*

> *"All things truly wicked start from innocence."*

> *"The writer's standard of fidelity to the truth should be so high that his invention, out of his experience, should produce a truer account than anything factual can be. For facts can be observed badly; but when a good writer is creating something, he has time and scope to make of it an absolute truth."*

## Extended Sample: "Big Two-Hearted River" — The War Beneath

This Nick Adams story (from *In Our Time*, 1925) is **the purest example of the Iceberg Theory**. The word "war" never appears. Yet it's entirely about a veteran recovering from war trauma.

### Opening

> "The train went on. The country was brown. There were few people. The train passed through a town at six o'clock in the morning."

### The Fishing (Full Sequence)

> "Nick knelt down and looked into the water. It was dark brown. It moved swiftly. As he watched, a trout rose to the surface, made a circle, and disappeared. Nick watched. He did not rig up the rod."

> "He was there, in the good place. He was in his home hole. He could feel it. He had gotten back."

> "He was there, in the good place. He was in his home. He could feel it. Nick slid the rod back. The movement felt perfectly natural."

### What's Omitted (But Felt)

- Why Nick is there
- His war wounds
- His psychological state
- Any mention of combat

### What Shows

- Fishing details
- River movement
- Physical sensations
- The rhythm of work

The result: **One of the most powerful war stories every written — without a single battle scene.**
