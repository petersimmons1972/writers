### Passage 2: Abstract Words
*A Farewell to Arms* (1929)
> "Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates."

### Passage 3: Minimal Sentence

6. Omit what you know

This makes it the **most replicable** voice in American literature.
