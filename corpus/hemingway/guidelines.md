# Hemingway Writing Guidelines - Zero-Defect Voice Replication

**Purpose**: Generate authentic Hemingway prose indistinguishable from the original
**Standard**: Every generated sentence must pass the Hemingway voice test

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. The Iceberg Theory (Non-Negotiable)

**Rule**: What you omit is as powerful as what you include.

**Application**:
- Show: Dialogue, action, visible objects
- Hide: Backstory, emotion, meaning
- Let the reader feel what isn't stated

**Example**:
- Weak: "He was sad because Maria had left him."
- Hemingway: "He ordered another drink. The glass was empty."

---

### 2. Short Sentences (Mandatory)

**Rule**: Average sentence length = 14-15 words. Maximum = 25 words.

**How to achieve**:
- Break compound sentences into simple ones
- Remove subordinate clauses
- Cut adjectives and adverbs that extend sentences

**Example**:
- Weak: "The train went on through the brown countryside as it passed by the small town at six o'clock in the morning."
- Hemingway: "The train went on. The country was brown. There were few people."

---

### 3. Minimal Adjectives/Adverbs (Mandatory)

**Rule**: Maximum 18 adjectives per 1,000 words (vs. 45 average).

**How to achieve**:
- Let nouns do the work
- If you write "the exhausted man," ask: can "the man" work alone?
- Remove intensifiers (very, really, extremely)
- Trust the reader to imagine

**Example**:
- Weak: "The icy, cold water was terribly cold and dangerously deep."
- Hemingway: "The water was cold. The fish was deep."

---

### 4. Simple Vocabulary (Mandatory)

**Rule**: 68%+ one-syllable words. Avoid Latinate vocabulary.

**How to achieve**:
- "Use" not "utilize"
- "Help" not "facilitate"  
- "About" not "approximately"
- "Stop" not "cease"
- "Get" not "obtain"

**Word list**:
| Avoid | Use |
|-------|-----|
| utilize | use |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | do/start |
| subsequently | then |
| approximately | about |
| demonstrate | show |
| sufficient | enough |
| commence | start/begin |

---

### 5. No Passive Voice (Non-Negotiable)

**Rule**: Active voice only. Subject performs action.

**How to achieve**:
- Find the actor and make them the subject
- Remove "was/were/been/being"

**Example**:
- Weak: "The ball was thrown by the pitcher."
- Hemingway: "The pitcher threw the ball."

---

### 6. Dialogue as Character Reveal (Key Technique)

**Rule**: Character revealed through what they say (and don't say).

**How to achieve**:
- Write realistic speech (people don't say what they mean)
- Include pauses, fragments, interruptions
- Let subtext carry meaning

**Example**:
> "You can't go to Chicago," he said.  
> "I know."  
> "Then why try?"  
> "Had to try."

The dialogue reveals his character without explanation.

---

### 7. Understatement (Key Technique)

**Rule**: Say less than what happened. Let the reader feel more.

**How to achieve**:
- Minimize significant events
- Let facts speak
- Avoid exclamations or emphatic language

**Example**:
- Weak: "The battle was absolutely devastating and horrible with thousands dying."
- Hemingway: "The war was not going well."

---

### 8. First-Person Authority (For Non-Fiction)

**Rule**: "I was there. I saw it. This is what happened."

**How to achieve**:
- Use first-person for witness accounts
- Be specific: names, places, times
- No hedging on what you observed

**Example**:
> "I had seen the true face of war. It was not what the generals described."

---

## STRUCTURAL RULES

### Paragraph Length

- **Maximum**: 6 sentences (rare)
- **Standard**: 2-3 sentences
- **Emphasis**: 1 sentence

### Scene Transitions

- Use white space
- Short paragraphs for pacing
- No long transitional passages

### Endings

- End on image, not summary
- Let the last image linger
- No explanations of what just happened

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (Never Do These)

| Pattern | Wrong | Hemingway Right |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Explain emotion | "He was sad and lonely" | No explanation; action reveals |
| Use adjectives | "the beautiful sunset" | "the sunset" |
| Use adverbs | "ran quickly" | "ran" |
| Abstract language | "the implementation of" | "the plan" |
| Flowery prose | "the crimson orb descended" | "the sun went down" |
| Passive voice | "was decided" | "decided" |
| hedging | "I think maybe" | "I saw" |
| backstory | "He had been born in..." | Start in scene |

## GENERATION PROTOCOL

### Step 1: Choose Subject

Pick something observable: action, dialogue, scene, object.

### Step 2: Write Short Sentences

Average 14 words. Count. Edit down.

### Step 3: Cut Adjectives/Adverbs

Remove 60%+ of adjectives. Let nouns work.

### Step 4: Replace Complex Words

Find simple Anglo-Saxon replacements.

### Step 5: Check Dialogue

If characters speak, make it realistic with subtext.

### Step 6: Apply Understatement

Minimize significant moments. Let reader feel.

### Step 7: Verify Iceberg

Remove explanations. Let unstated carry weight.

## VOICE TEST

Before publishing any Hemingway-style content, verify:

1. [ ] Average sentence length 14-15 words?
2. [ ] Adjectives under 20 per 1,000 words?
3. [ ] Adverbs under 10 per 1,000 words?
4. [ ] 65%+ one-syllable words?
5. [ ] Zero passive voice?
6. [ ] Dialogue reveals character?
7. [ ] Understatement used for impact?
8. [ ] No explanations of emotion?
9. [ ] Ending on image, not summary?
10. [ ] What isn't said carries weight?

**Score**: 8/10 minimum for Hemingway authenticity.

## COMMON ERRORS

### Error 1: Too Many Adjectives
**Fix**: Remove all but essential. Test: Can the noun stand alone?

### Error 2: Explaining Emotion
**Fix**: Show action instead. "He was sad" → "He did not speak."

### Error 3: Long Sentences
**Fix**: Break into two. Count words.

### Error 4: Abstract Language
**Fix**: Replace with concrete. "Implementation" → "plan"

### Error 5: Passive Voice
**Fix**: Find actor, make subject.

## EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATION

**Input** (weak):
"The deployment was completely successful and the team was very excited about the results. We had been working on this for three months and it finally worked exactly as planned."

**Hemingway Transformation**:
"The deployment worked. The tests passed. We had worked three months on it. Now it was done. The team did not celebrate. There was still more to do."

**Changes**:
- Split into short sentences
- Removed "completely," "very," "excited"
- Understatement: "Now it was done"
- No explanation of emotion
- Ended on action, not summary
