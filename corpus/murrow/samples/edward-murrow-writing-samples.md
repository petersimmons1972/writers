# Edward R. Murrow: Authentic Broadcast Transcripts and Style Analysis

## Overview

Edward Roscoe Murrow (1908-1965) was the defining voice of broadcast journalism in the 20th century. As CBS's chief European correspondent during World War II, his "This Is London" broadcasts brought the war into American living rooms. His post-war television work, particularly "See It Now," helped define broadcast news standards. He was famous for two phrases: his opening "This is London" and his closing "Good night, and good luck."

Unlike print journalists, Murrow wrote for the ear. His transcripts reveal a writer who understood rhythm, pause, and the power of understated delivery. He pioneered live radio journalism from active war zones, broadcasting from London rooftops during the Blitz and flying on bombing missions over Berlin.

## Sample 1: Declaration of War Broadcast (September 3, 1939)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** War declaration

### Transcript Text

This is London calling Columbia, New York. Now first, let's get in proper order the chronological developments of the day. At nine o'clock this morning, London time, it was announced that a two-hour ultimatum had been delivered to Germany, that at the end of that time, hostilities must cease or Germany and Britain would be at war.

At 11:15, the prime minister spoke to the nation. He stated that no reply had been received to the ultimatum, and that Britain and Germany were at war. Shortly after the prime minister's speech, the air raid sirens went off, and it wasn't a pleasant sound. We moved quietly and in orderly fashion down underground.

The all-clear came in just a little while. Now, for the last few hours I haven't had an opportunity to be up on the streets of London to see what is happening, but I have heard one story concerning that air raid siren, and I think that story might interest you.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening formula:** "This is London calling Columbia, New York." -- formal, precise, establishing the transatlantic bridge.
- **Chronological precision:** "At nine o'clock... At 11:15..." -- Murrow structures by time, creating a ticking-clock narrative.
- **Understatement:** "it wasn't a pleasant sound" -- describing air raid sirens with British reserve.
- **First person plural:** "We moved quietly" -- Murrow includes himself among the Londoners.
- **Conversational pivot:** "I think that story might interest you" -- addresses the American listener directly, almost casually.

## Sample 2: London Rooftop Broadcast (September 21, 1940)

**Type:** Live rooftop broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Battle of Britain / London Blitz

### Transcript Text

I'm standing on a rooftop looking out over London. At the moment, everything is quiet. For reasons of national as well as personal security, I am unable to tell you the exact location from which I'm speaking. Off to my left, far away in the distance, I can see just that faint, red, angry snap of anti-aircraft bursts against the steel-blue sky. But the guns are so far away that it's impossible to hear them from this location. About five minutes ago the guns in the immediate vicinity were working. I can look across just at the building not far away and see something that looks like a splash of white paint down the side. And I know from daylight observation that about a quarter of that building has disappeared, hit by a bomb the other night.

I was up here earlier this afternoon. And looking out over these housetops, looking all the way to the dome of St. Paul's, I saw many flags flying from staffs. No one ordered these people to put out the flags, they simply feel like flying the Union Jack above their roof. No one told them to do it, and no flag up there was white. I can see one or two of them just stirring very faintly in the breeze now.

Earlier this evening, we heard a number of bombs go sliding and slithering across to fall several blocks away. Just overhead now, the bursts of the anti-aircraft fire. The searchlights now are feeling almost directly overhead. Now you'll hear two bursts a little nearer in a moment... There they are, that hard stony sound.

### Style Analysis

- **Present tense throughout:** "I'm standing... I can see... the searchlights now are feeling..." -- real-time narration creates immediacy and danger.
- **Sensory precision:** "that faint, red, angry snap" -- three adjectives building to a verb-as-noun. The snap is angry.
- **Observation as metaphor:** "a splash of white paint down the side" -- a bomb crater becomes art description.
- **Civilian courage detail:** The flags. "No one ordered these people... no flag up there was white." Murrow says everything by saying what the flags are NOT.
- **Sound as character:** "bombs go sliding and slithering" -- onomatopoeic verbs making bombs animal-like.
- **Breaking the fourth wall:** "Now you'll hear two bursts... There they are" -- brings the listener INTO the moment. Radio's equivalent of a live shot.
- **"That hard stony sound":** A description of anti-aircraft fire that is simultaneously precise and poetic.

## Sample 3: Trafalgar Square Broadcast (1940)

**Type:** Live street broadcast ("London After Dark") | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz

### Transcript Text

This is Trafalgar Square. The noise that you hear at the moment is the sound of the air raid sirens. I'm standing here just on the steps of St.-Martin's-in-the-Fields. The little traffic lights here -- just a small cross on the normal globe -- are now red. The cars pull up and stop. I'll just ooze down in the darkness here along these steps and see if I can pick up the sound of people's feet as they walk along. One of the strangest sounds one can hear in London these days or rather these dark nights, just the sound of footsteps walking along the street. Like ghosts shod with steel shoes.

### Style Analysis

- **Place-naming:** "This is Trafalgar Square" -- Murrow always grounds you geographically.
- **"Ooze":** "I'll just ooze down in the darkness" -- an unusual, almost playful verb choice amid danger. Murrow could be wry.
- **Sound over sight:** In radio, Murrow privileges what can be HEARD. Footsteps become the story.
- **Simile:** "Like ghosts shod with steel shoes." This is literature, not journalism. The image is medieval, gothic, and perfectly captures blackout-London.
- **Self-correction:** "these days or rather these dark nights" -- the correction feels unscripted, authentic, like real thought in real time.

## Sample 4: "Britain Prepares for the Worst" (March 9, 1941)

**Type:** Radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz

### Transcript Text

This is London.

Soon it will be spring in England. Already there are flowers in the parks, although the parks aren't quite as well kept as they were this time last year. But there's good fighting weather ahead. In four days' time the moon will be full again, and there's a feeling in the air that big things will happen soon.

The winter that is ending has been hard, but Londoners have many reasons for satisfaction. There have been no serious epidemics. The casualties from air bombardments have been less than expected. And London meets this spring with as much courage, though less complacency, than at this time last year.

Many ancient buildings have been destroyed. Acts of individual heroism have been commonplace. More damage has been done by fire than by high explosives. The things cast down by the Germans out of the night skies have made hundreds of thousands of people homeless. I've seen them standing cruel cold of a winter morning with tears frozen on their faces looking at the little pile of rubble that was their homes and saying over and over again in a toneless, unbelieving way: "What have we done to deserve this?"

But the winter has brought some improved conditions in the underground shelters. It has brought, too, reduced rations; repeated warnings of the imminence of invasion; shorter restrictions upon the freedom of the individual and organizations.

### Style Analysis

- **Seasonal framing:** Opens with spring. The natural world is indifferent to war. "flowers in the parks, although the parks aren't quite as well kept."
- **Ominous beauty:** "good fighting weather" -- the moon that brings beauty brings bombers.
- **Balanced structure:** "as much courage, though less complacency" -- rhetorical balance, almost Churchillian.
- **The human detail:** "tears frozen on their faces... saying over and over again in a toneless, unbelieving way" -- Murrow gives us one specific image to carry the weight of "hundreds of thousands."
- **Litany technique:** Lists damages, then lists improvements. The form mirrors the Londoners' own stoic accounting.
- **Understated foreboding:** "big things will happen soon" -- this is 1941. Murrow knows what's coming.

## Sample 5: "Orchestrated Hell" -- Berlin Bombing Mission (December 3, 1943)

**Type:** Studio broadcast (recorded after flight) | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Strategic bombing campaign

### Key Passages

"This is London. Last night, some of the young gentlemen of the RAF took me to Berlin."

"We went out and stood around the big, black four-motored Lancaster, 'D for Dog.'"

"Everyone sounded relaxed. For a while, the eight of us in our little world in exile moved over the sea."

"Steady lads, we've been coned."

"Jock was wearing woolen gloves with the fingers cut off. I could see his fingernails turn white as he gripped the wheel."

"The clouds were gone, and the sticks of incendiaries from the preceding waves made the place look like a badly laid-out city with the streetlights on."

"I looked on the port beam at the target area. There was a red, sullen, obscene glare."

"Berlin was a kind of orchestrated hell -- a terrible symphony of light and flame."

"The job isn't pleasant -- it's terribly tiring. Men die in the sky while others are roasted alive in their cellars."

"In about thirty-five minutes it was hit with about three times the amount of stuff that ever came down on London in a night-long blitz."

"This is a calculated, remorseless campaign of destruction. Right now the mechanics are probably working on D-Dog, getting him ready to fly again."

"I return you now to CBS New York."

### Style Analysis

- **The opening line:** "Last night, some of the young gentlemen of the RAF took me to Berlin." -- ironic courtesy ("young gentlemen") juxtaposed with the terror of a bombing run. This is Murrow's signature: controlled language around uncontrolled violence.
- **Physical detail under pressure:** "fingernails turn white as he gripped the wheel" -- Murrow observes like a novelist even while terrified.
- **Extended metaphor:** "orchestrated hell -- a terrible symphony" -- war as music, destruction as performance. This is the broadcast's thesis compressed into a phrase.
- **Moral complexity:** "Men die in the sky while others are roasted alive in their cellars." One sentence acknowledging both the bomber crews and the civilians below. Murrow does not flinch from what bombing means.
- **Colloquial deflation:** "the job isn't pleasant" -- British understatement absorbed into Murrow's American voice.
- **Closing formula:** "I return you now to CBS New York." -- the formal hand-off, re-establishing the bridge between London and America.

## Sample 6: Buchenwald Liberation Broadcast (April 15, 1945)

**Type:** Radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Liberation of concentration camps

### Transcript Text

Permit me to tell you what you would have seen and heard had you been with me on Thursday. It will not be pleasant listening. If you are at lunch, or if you have no appetite to hear what Germans have done, now is a good time to switch off the radio, for I propose to tell you of Buchenwald.

[Murrow then describes entering the camp, the conditions, the prisoners:]

I asked to see one of the barracks. It happened to be occupied by Czechoslovaks. When I entered, men crowded around, tried to lift me to their shoulders. They were too weak. Many of them could not get out of bed.

[On the bodies:]

There were two rows of bodies stacked up like cordwood. They were thin and very white.

[Closing:]

I pray you to believe what I have said about Buchenwald. I reported what I saw and heard, but only part of it. For most of it, I have no words.

If I have offended you by this rather mild account of Buchenwald, I'm not in the least sorry.

### Style Analysis

- **The warning:** "If you are at lunch, or if you have no appetite to hear..." -- Murrow gives the listener permission to leave, which makes those who stay complicit witnesses. A brilliant rhetorical move.
- **"Permit me":** Formal, almost courtly. The politeness is devastating against the horror.
- **Concrete physical detail:** "too weak" to lift him. "Two rows of bodies stacked up like cordwood." He does not use abstractions.
- **Admitted inadequacy:** "For most of it, I have no words." -- From Murrow, whose entire career was built on having words, this silence speaks.
- **Unapologetic closing:** "I'm not in the least sorry." -- Murrow drops the diplomatic tone. This is the angriest sentence he ever broadcast.
- **Three-day delay:** Murrow waited three days after visiting Buchenwald before broadcasting. He needed time to find words. The restraint is the point.

## Sample 7: See It Now -- McCarthy Editorial Opening (March 9, 1954)

**Type:** Television editorial | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** See It Now

### Transcript Text (Closing Editorial)

No one familiar with the history of this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men -- not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.

This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.

The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it -- and rather successfully. Cassius was right: "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

Good night, and good luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Concession then strike:** "congressional committees are useful" -- acknowledges the valid before demolishing the invalid. Classic Murrow fairness-as-weapon.
- **Parallel construction:** "We must not... We must remember... We will not walk... We will not be driven..." -- rhetorical anaphora building to a crescendo.
- **Historical grounding:** "we are not descended from fearful men" -- appeals to American identity, not partisan politics.
- **Balanced condemnation:** "This is no time for men who oppose... to keep silent, or for those who approve." -- challenges BOTH sides.
- **The pivot:** "And whose fault is that? Not really his." -- Murrow blames the public, not just McCarthy. This is radical honesty.
- **Shakespeare:** Closing with Julius Caesar elevates the commentary to tragedy. McCarthy is Cassius. America is Brutus.
- **Sign-off:** "Good night, and good luck." -- the same words every broadcast, but here they carry the weight of everything preceding them.

## Sample 8: Response to McCarthy (April 13, 1954)

**Type:** Television editorial | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** See It Now

### Transcript Text

Last week, Senator McCarthy appeared on this program to correct any errors he might have thought we made in our report of March 9th.

Since he made no reference to any statements of fact that we made, we must conclude that he found no errors of fact. He proved again that anyone who exposes him, anyone who does not share his hysterical disregard for decency and human dignity and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, must be either a Communist or a fellow traveler.

I fully expected this treatment. The Senator added this reporter's name to a long list of individuals and institutions he has accused of serving the Communist cause. His proposition is very simple: Anyone who criticizes or opposes McCarthy's methods must be a Communist. And if that be true, there are an awful lot of Communists in this country.

For the record, let's consider briefly some of the Senator's charges. He claimed, but offered no proof, that I had been a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. That is false. I was never a member of the IWW, never applied for membership. Men that I worked with in the Pacific Northwest in western Washington in logging camps will attest that I had never had any affiliation or affinity with that organization.

The Senator charged that Professor Harold Laski, a British scholar and politician, dedicated a book to me. That's true. He is dead. He was a socialist -- I am not. He was one of those civilized individuals who did not insist upon agreement with his political principles as a pre-condition for conversation or friendship. I do not agree with his political ideas. Laski, as he makes clear in the introduction, dedicated the book to me not because of political agreement but because he held my wartime broadcast from London in high regard -- and the dedication so reads.

I believed 20 years ago and I believe today that mature Americans can engage in conversation and controversy, the clash of ideas, with Communists anywhere in the world without becoming contaminated or converted. I believe that our faith, our conviction, our determination are stronger than theirs, and that we can compete -- and successfully, not only in the area of bombs but in the area of ideas.

Having searched my conscience and my files, I cannot contend that I have always been right or wise. But I have attempted to pursue the truth with some diligence and to report it, even though, as in this case, I had been warned in advance that I would be subjected to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

We shall hope to deal with matters of more vital interest to the country next week.

Good night, and good luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Logical dismantling:** Murrow takes each charge, states it, then destroys it with evidence. The structure is methodical, almost legal.
- **Dry wit:** "there are an awful lot of Communists in this country" -- sardonic understatement.
- **"He is dead.":** Two words, one period. The brevity makes the accusation against a dead man seem even more cowardly.
- **Personal credential:** "Men that I worked with... in logging camps" -- Murrow establishes his working-class, American bona fides against McCarthy's innuendo.
- **Moral clarity:** "mature Americans can engage in conversation... without becoming contaminated or converted." This is Murrow's core belief -- that democracy is strong enough to face its enemies openly.
- **Self-criticism:** "I cannot contend that I have always been right or wise." -- Murrow concedes his own fallibility, which makes his certainty about McCarthy more powerful.
- **Dismissive closing:** "matters of more vital interest to the country next week" -- McCarthy is not vital. This is the final insult.

## Sample 9: "Harvest of Shame" Opening and Closing (November 25, 1960)

**Type:** Television documentary | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** CBS Reports

### Opening

This scene is not taking place in the Congo. It has nothing to do with Johannesburg or Cape Town. It is not Nyasaland or Nigeria. This is Florida. These are citizens of the United States, 1960. This is a shape-up for migrant workers. The hawkers are chanting the going piece rate at the various fields. This is the way the humans who harvest the food for the best-fed people in the world get hired.

We present this report on Thanksgiving because were it not for the labor of the people you're going to meet, you might not starve, but your table would not be laden with the luxuries that we have all come to regard as essentials.

### Closing

The migrants have no lobby. Only an enlightened, aroused and perhaps angered public opinion can do anything about the migrants. The people you have seen have the strength to harvest your fruit and vegetables. They do not have the strength to influence legislation. Maybe we do. Good night, and good luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Negative definition:** "not the Congo... not Johannesburg... not Nyasaland." Murrow defines by exclusion, building shock. You expect Africa. He gives you Florida.
- **"These are citizens":** Three words that carry the full moral argument.
- **Thanksgiving timing:** "We present this report on Thanksgiving because..." -- Murrow weaponizes the holiday. Your meal is their labor.
- **"The best-fed people in the world":** Ironic compliment that becomes accusation.
- **Call to action:** "Maybe we do." -- understated, leaving the audience to fill in the conviction.
- **Structural symmetry:** Opens with what they lack (power), closes with what we have (power). The gap IS the argument.

## Sample 10: Anschluss / Austria Broadcast (March 13, 1938)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Pre-war / Nazi expansion

### Key Passages

"This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna. It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning, and Herr Hitler has not yet arrived."

"Many people are in a holiday mood; they lift the right arm a little higher here than Berlin and the 'Heil Hitler' is said a little more loudly. Young storm troopers are riding about the streets, singing and tossing oranges out to the crowd."

"It was called a bloodless conquest, and in some ways it was. But I'd like to be able to forget the haunted looks on the faces of those long lines of people outside the banks and travel offices."

### Style Analysis

- **Time-stamping:** "It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning" -- grounds the listener in the real moment.
- **Observed detail:** "they lift the right arm a little higher here than Berlin" -- the small difference tells the whole story of zealous converts.
- **Ironic juxtaposition:** "singing and tossing oranges" alongside the Heil Hitler salute. Festivity as fascism.
- **"Bloodless conquest":** Murrow quotes the official line, then immediately undercuts it with "I'd like to be able to forget" -- personal inability to accept the sanitized version.
- **This was Murrow's first field report.** The voice that would define broadcast journalism began here, in Vienna at 2:30 AM.

---

## Sample 11: V-E Day Broadcast (May 8, 1945)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** End of European war

### Key Passages

"London is a curious town. Nothing seems to surprise it, not even buzz bombs. There are little streets where you may meet anyone. And tonight, it's easy to imagine that old friends are walking there. Some of the boys you watched jump at Remagen. Flyers you watched go down in flames over Berlin or a dozen other targets. And you wonder what's happened to the American boys who used to stand on those street corners far from home and rather lonesome."

"The soldiers who waited and trained for D-Day, and who since demonstrated that they were not living on the reputations made by their grandfathers."

"Six years is a long time. I have observed today that people have very little to say. There are no words."

### Style Analysis

- **Ghostly presence:** Murrow peoples V-E Day London with the dead -- "old friends" who aren't there, boys who "used to stand" on corners. The celebration is haunted.
- **"Rather lonesome":** British understatement applied to American soldiers. Murrow absorbed British speech patterns during his years in London.
- **Generational pride:** "not living on the reputations made by their grandfathers" -- validates this generation's sacrifice.
- **Silence as eloquence:** "people have very little to say. There are no words." -- Murrow, the man OF words, closes the war with their absence.
- **Echo:** "Six years is a long time" mirrors the opening of the war. Full circle.

## Sample 12: "One Becomes Accustomed" -- Blitz Commentary Fragments

**Type:** Radio broadcasts | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz, 1940-41

### Key Passages

"One becomes accustomed to rattling windows and the distant sound of bombs, and then there comes a silence that can be felt."

"There are no words to describe the thing that is happening."

"You laid the dead of London at our doors, and we knew that the dead were our dead."

"This was a calculated, remorseless campaign of destruction."

### Style Analysis

- **"A silence that can be felt":** Synesthesia -- silence as physical sensation. This is poetry.
- **"There are no words":** Murrow's recurring admission of language's failure against reality.
- **"Our dead":** Murrow claims the British dead for America. This is advocacy disguised as reporting. He was drawing America toward the war.
- **"Calculated, remorseless":** Two adjectives that carry more weight than a paragraph of description.

---

## Sample 13: RTNDA "Wires and Lights" Speech -- Key Passages (October 15, 1958)

**Type:** Speech at RTNDA convention | **Period:** Post-war media criticism

### Key Passages

"This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it's nothing but wires and lights in a box."

"There is a great and perhaps decisive battle to be fought against ignorance, intolerance, and indifference. This weapon of television could be useful."

"If we go on as we are, then history will take its revenge, and retribution will not limp in catching up with us."

### Style Analysis

- **Technology as neutral:** "wires and lights in a box" -- reduces television to its physical components, stripping away the mythology.
- **Conditional threat:** "if we go on as we are" -- Murrow frames media failure as historical crime.
- **"Retribution will not limp":** Personification of consequence as pursuer. Biblical in tone.
- **Audience as accused:** Murrow delivered this to the very people he was criticizing. The courage of the speech was in the room, not the content.

---

## Common Patterns Across All Samples

### Sentence Structure
- **Medium to long sentences:** Murrow's sentences are generally longer than Pyle's. He builds through subordinate clauses.
- **Rhetorical parallelism:** "We must not... We must remember... We will not..." -- his sentences march in formation.
- **Periodic sentences:** Places the key idea at the END: "It's nothing but wires and lights in a box."
- **Short sentences for devastating effect:** "He is dead." / "There are no words." / "Six years is a long time."
- **Conditional constructions:** "If we go on... if you are at lunch... had you been with me..."

### Paragraph Organization
- **Opening with place/time:** "This is London." / "This is Trafalgar Square." / "It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning."
- **Building blocks:** Paragraphs accumulate evidence, then the final paragraph delivers the verdict.
- **Chronological in war broadcasts:** Events unfold in real time.
- **Logical in editorials:** Claim, evidence, counter-evidence, conclusion.

### Transition Styles
- **Temporal:** "Shortly after... Earlier this evening... Last week..."
- **Pivot questions:** "And whose fault is that?" -- the question IS the transition.
- **Negation chains:** "not the Congo... not Johannesburg... not Nyasaland" -- building through what something is NOT.

### Voice Quirks and Repeated Phrases
- **"This is London."** -- The signature opening. Three words that became a brand.
- **"Good night, and good luck."** -- The signature closing. Borrowed from Londoners during the Blitz.
- **"I'm standing on..."** -- Grounds himself physically in the scene.
- **"For reasons of..."** -- Formal, almost bureaucratic framing for dangerous situations.
- **"Permit me to..."** -- Courtly formality, especially before difficult content.
- **"I have observed..."** -- Personal witness statement, authoritative but not declarative.
- **"The junior Senator from Wisconsin"** -- Formal title used as distancing mechanism, almost contemptuous.
- **"I return you now to CBS New York."** -- The hand-off, the bridge between worlds.

### Opening Patterns
- **Geographic declaration:** "This is London." / "This is Trafalgar Square."
- **Temporal grounding:** "It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning."
- **Ironic setup:** "Last night, some of the young gentlemen of the RAF took me to Berlin."
- **Warning/permission:** "Permit me to tell you... It will not be pleasant listening."
- **Negation chain:** "This scene is not taking place in the Congo..."

### Closing Patterns
- **"Good night, and good luck."** -- the constant sign-off, but its weight changes with context.
- **Shakespeare and literary allusion:** "The fault, dear Brutus..."
- **Admitted silence:** "For most of it, I have no words." / "There are no words."
- **Call to action:** "Maybe we do." / "Perhaps angered public opinion..."
- **Unapologetic:** "I'm not in the least sorry."
- **Formal hand-off:** "I return you now to CBS New York."

### Punctuation Patterns
- **Em-dashes:** Frequent. "a terrible symphony of light and flame -- " / "it's terribly tiring -- " / Murrow uses dashes for dramatic pauses that would be audible in broadcast.
- **Ellipses:** More common than in Pyle. "Now you'll hear two bursts a little nearer in a moment... There they are." The ellipsis represents a broadcast pause.
- **Semicolons:** Used in formal editorials. "It is necessary to investigate before legislating; but the line..."
- **Commas for rhythm:** Murrow's commas mark where he would pause in speech.

### Tone and Emotional Register
- **Controlled authority:** Murrow almost never raises his voice (in text or delivery). The power is in the restraint.
- **Ironic courtesy:** "young gentlemen" for bomber crews. "Permit me" before describing Buchenwald.
- **British-inflected formality:** Years in London gave Murrow a mid-Atlantic quality. "rather lonesome" instead of "lonely."
- **Moral certainty without preaching:** Murrow states his positions as facts, not opinions. "We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty" is declarative, not argumentative.
- **Anger expressed through precision:** When Murrow is angriest, his language becomes most exact. "I'm not in the least sorry."
- **Grief as silence:** When emotion overwhelms, Murrow stops talking. "There are no words." This is his most powerful technique.

### Distinctive Markers That Make Murrow Recognizable
1. **Geographic/temporal grounding** in the first sentence -- always tells you where and when
2. **"This is London"** or equivalent place-claim opening
3. **Formal courtesy before difficult content** ("Permit me...")
4. **Rhetorical parallel construction** (We must... We will... We cannot...)
5. **Ironic juxtaposition** -- casual language for terrifying events
6. **Physical observation under pressure** -- what he SEES matters as much as what he thinks
7. **Sound description** in broadcast transcripts -- "that hard stony sound"
8. **British understatement absorbed into American speech**
9. **Shakespeare and literary allusion** at climactic moments
10. **"Good night, and good luck"** -- the sign-off that carries the weight of everything preceding it
11. **Admitted failure of language** as the most powerful rhetorical device
12. **Present tense for immediacy** in war broadcasts vs. past tense for reflection

## Key Differences: Murrow vs. Pyle

| Dimension | Murrow | Pyle |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Medium** | Broadcast (wrote for the ear) | Print (wrote for the eye) |
| **Perspective** | From the balcony, the rooftop, the overview | From the foxhole, the cowshed, ground level |
| **Subjects** | Events, nations, forces, moral questions | Individual soldiers, small details, personal gear |
| **Sentence style** | Rhetorical, parallel, periodic | Compound "and" chains, conversational |
| **Emotion** | Controlled authority, formal restraint | Everyman vulnerability, admitted confusion |
| **When overwhelmed** | "There are no words" (declares silence) | Goes to sleep (acts normal) |
| **Anger** | Becomes more precise | Becomes more terse |
| **Literary allusion** | Shakespeare, history, formal rhetoric | Almost none -- writes in plain speech |
| **First person** | "I have observed" (authoritative witness) | "I don't know why" (confused participant) |
| **Signature weakness** | Could seem detached, broadcasting FROM the crisis | Could seem too emotionally involved |
