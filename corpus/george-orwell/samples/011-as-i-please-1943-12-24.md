## Summary

Orwell responds to A. K. Chesterton's criticism regarding patriotism and war. Chesterton had attacked Orwell for questioning the maxim "My country—right or wrong." Orwell argues that while defending one's nation against invasion is justified, supporting "any war" unconditionally is not. He references G. K. Chesterton's opposition to the Boer War and his observation that blind patriotism equals saying "My mother, drunk or sober"—both morally indefensible positions.
