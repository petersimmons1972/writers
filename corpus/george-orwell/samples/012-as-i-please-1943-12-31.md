## Summary

This column examines war guilt and objective truth. Orwell notes the paradox that Hitler hasn't personally committed "actionable" crimes like rape or torture, yet bears responsibility for a world war costing millions of lives. He argues that legality requires authority transcending national boundaries, which doesn't exist.

The piece critiques how totalitarianism "attacks the concept of objective truth" and claims control over both past and future. Orwell expresses concern about historical accuracy becoming determined by military victory rather than evidence: "History is written by the winners." He concludes that Britain's advantage lies in potentially telling fewer lies than adversaries, and hopes liberal traditions valuing objective truth survive the conflict.
