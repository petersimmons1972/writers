# Looking Back on the Spanish War (1943)

**Source:** https://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/Spanish_War/english/esw_1
**Date:** 1943
**Genre:** Personal/Political Essay
**Word Count:** ~12,000 words (7 sections)

## Main Themes

**Physical Reality vs. Romantic Idealism**: Orwell emphasizes that revolutionary armies face the same unglamorous hardships as any military force. "Latrines are an overworked subject in war literature," yet they illustrated how soldiers' actual experience contradicted political narratives about fighting for democracy.

**Propaganda and Truth**: The essay critiques how all sides distorted facts about the conflict. Orwell observed that people believed atrocities committed by enemies while dismissing those by their own side—a pattern he saw repeating across different conflicts.

**The Power of Personal Moments**: Two incidents stand out: when Orwell spared a Fascist soldier pulling up his trousers, and later when a Barcelona street boy he'd earlier doubted defended him passionately. These moments revealed the human capacity for reconciliation during revolutionary fervor.

**Working-Class Resilience**: Orwell argues that ordinary workers represent the most reliable opposition to fascism, as they cannot be permanently bribed and recognize when promises fail.

**Historical Implications**: Most troublingly, Orwell warns that systematic propaganda could rewrite history itself—a "nightmare" where totalitarian powers control not just the future but the past.

The essay concludes with verses honoring an Italian militiaman whose face symbolized the war's true stakes: whether common people could achieve dignified, fully human lives.
