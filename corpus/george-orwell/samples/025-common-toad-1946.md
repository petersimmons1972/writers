## Summary

George Orwell's 1946 essay celebrates the simple pleasures of spring, using the common toad as his central metaphor. The piece argues for the importance of finding joy in nature even amid political and social upheaval.

## Key Themes

**Nature's Return**: Orwell describes the toad's emergence from hibernation and its journey to breeding grounds with vivid detail, noting that "a toad has about the most beautiful eye of any living creature."

**Urban Nature**: He observes that natural phenomena persist even in London's industrial heart—birds nest among gasworks, and spring arrives regardless of urban decay.

**Political Philosophy**: The essay engages with left-wing criticism that appreciating nature represents political quietism. Orwell counters that denying natural pleasures doesn't strengthen the cause for social change; rather, it impoverishes future visions of a better society.

**Human Connection**: He suggests that maintaining "childhood love of such things as trees, fishes, butterflies and...toads" makes "a peaceful and decent future a little more probable."

## Central Argument

Orwell insists that genuine freedom includes the ability to enjoy spring's arrival—something no authority can ultimately suppress, even amid war, surveillance, and propaganda.

The essay was first published in *Tribune* magazine and later collected in *Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays* (1950).
