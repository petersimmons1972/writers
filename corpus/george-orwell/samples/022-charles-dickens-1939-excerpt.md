## Opening Argument and Method

George Orwell's 1939 essay on Charles Dickens demonstrates his distinctive critical style through several key moves. He begins provocatively, claiming that "Dickens is one of those writers who are well worth stealing," establishing immediately that Dickens has become a contested literary figure claimed by competing ideological camps.

Orwell's strategy involves systematic debunking of these appropriations. He notes how Chesterton, Marxist critics, and religious interpreters all attempt to claim Dickens as their own—as medievalist, revolutionary, or Catholic champion. Against this, Orwell invokes Lenin's reported walkout from a Dickens dramatization, suggesting the Russian leader found Dickens's "middle-class sentimentality" intolerable.

## The Core Interpretive Move

Rather than accepting any single ideological reading, Orwell methodically establishes what Dickens was *not*. He argues Dickens cannot be properly classified as a "proletarian" or truly "revolutionary" writer. The evidence: Dickens rarely depicts working-class life authentically, focusing instead on London's commercial bourgeoisie—"lawyers, clerks, tradesmen, innkeepers, small craftsmen, and servants."

Orwell's hallmark is combining textual analysis with social observation. He notes that memorable "proletarian" characters—Bill Sykes, Sam Weller, Mrs. Gamp—represent a "burglar, a valet, and a drunken midwife," hardly representative of actual workers.

## Dickens's Moral Rather Than Structural Critique

The essay's crucial argument: Dickens's social criticism operates almost exclusively on moral grounds rather than addressing systemic economic structures. Orwell observes that Dickens "attacks the law, parliamentary government, the educational system" without proposing alternatives, and crucially, shows "no clear sign that he wants the existing order to be overthrown."

This insight reveals Orwell's sophisticated understanding of how ideology functions through apparent radicalism that ultimately reinforces existing hierarchies.
