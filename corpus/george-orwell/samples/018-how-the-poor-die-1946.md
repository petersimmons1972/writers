**Word Count:** ~4,000 words

## Summary

This essay recounts Orwell's experience hospitalized in Paris during 1929 with pneumonia. The narrative reveals the stark conditions of public hospital wards and reflects on historical attitudes toward medical institutions.

## Key Narrative Elements

**The Admission Experience:**
Orwell describes arriving at Hôpital X with a high fever, subjected to lengthy questioning before admission. The initial bath in February weather while suffering pneumonia set a grim tone for his stay.

**Medical Treatments:**
The essay details uncomfortable procedures including cupping (glass suction treatments) and mustard poultices applied without consent or explanation. Orwell observes: "a few feeble protests that I uttered got no more response than if I had been an animal."

**Ward Conditions:**
The ward featured crowded beds with minimal privacy, poor sanitation, and indifferent staff. Patients received minimal attention unless their conditions interested medical students. Orwell notes the ward contained "every sort of disease" with patients suffering visibly from various ailments.

**Death and Indifference:**
The death of Number 57, a cirrhosis patient, exemplifies institutional callousness—his body remained visible to other patients, his passing initially unnoticed until morning.

## Historical Context

Orwell contrasts modern medical practice with 19th-century horror-literature depictions of hospitals as torture chambers, arguing that while progress exists, institutional dehumanization persists.

## Voice Characteristics
- 17-year gap between experience (1929) and writing (1946)

- Patients referred to by numbers (Number 57)
- Quotable line: "got no more response than if I had been an animal"
- Connects personal trauma to historical patterns
- Class analysis (poor die differently than rich)
- Calm narrative tone about disturbing events
