**Date:** April 28, 1944
**Genre:** Journalism/Column
**Word Count:** ~1,200 words (two-part column)

## Part One: Freedom Under Dictatorship

Orwell recounts a 1940 conversation in the Café Royal with a young pacifist painter who believed a German occupation would allow secret intellectual freedom. Orwell uses this anecdote to refute what he calls "a very dangerous fallacy"—the notion that one can remain mentally free under totalitarian rule.

His core argument: creative work requires external stimulation and audience engagement. As he states, "It is almost impossible to think without talking." Remove freedom of speech and "the creative faculties dry up." He predicts that post-war Europe will reveal surprisingly little worthwhile writing produced secretly under dictators.

## Part Two: The Modern Girl and Cosmetics

Orwell responds to magistrate Basil Henriques's complaints about contemporary girls' appearance and behavior. Rather than accepting modern concerns as novel, Orwell provides historical context showing that societies have long condemned women's cosmetic use and fashion choices—"The Modern Girl has been just the same for quite two thousand years."

He catalogs failed attempts across centuries and cultures to discourage makeup, from Roman philosophers to Nazi ideology, concluding that such practices persist regardless of official disapproval. He humorously notes that even imprisoned women find ways to apply cosmetics.
