## Complete Narrative Summary

George Orwell's 1936 essay recounts his experience as a colonial police officer in Burma confronting a rogue elephant.

## The Setup

Orwell served as a sub-divisional police officer in Moulmein, facing intense anti-European hostility. He describes the internal conflict of opposing imperialism theoretically while enforcing it practically, noting: "I was stuck between my hatred of the empire I served and my rage against the evil-spirited little beasts."

## The Incident

Called to handle an escaped working elephant in the bazaar, Orwell initially intended only to observe. The animal had killed an Indian laborer, its trunk and foot crushing him into the mud. However, a massive crowd gathered expecting the officer with the rifle to shoot.

## The Moral Dilemma

Orwell recognized the elephant posed minimal danger and killing it represented economic loss (100 pounds alive versus 5 pounds dead). Yet he felt trapped by expectations: "I had got to shoot the elephant after all. The people expected it of me."

## The Realization

The incident crystallized Orwell's understanding of imperialism's hollowness. He perceived himself as "an absurd puppet pushed to and fro" by native expectations, noting that colonial rule required constant performance to maintain authority.

## The Conclusion

After shooting the elephant with difficulty, Orwell reflected that he acted "solely to avoid looking a fool"—revealing imperialism's true nature as mutual entrapment.
