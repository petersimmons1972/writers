## Summary

George Orwell's 1947 essay recounts his traumatic experiences at St Cyprian's, an expensive preparatory school in Eastbourne, England.

## Key Themes

**Bed-Wetting and Punishment**: Young Orwell begins wetting his bed upon arrival at age eight. Rather than understanding this as a normal stress response, the school treats it as willful misconduct, culminating in brutal canings that paradoxically end the problem.

**Class Hierarchy**: The essay reveals systematic discrimination based on wealth. As a scholarship student whose parents paid reduced fees, Orwell experienced overt humiliation—denied a cricket bat because "your parents couldn't afford it," given less pocket money than wealthy peers, and never receiving a birthday cake.

**Academic Exploitation**: Sambo (the headmaster) and Flip (his wife) cynically crammed scholarship candidates with examination material rather than genuine education. As Orwell notes: "Your job was to learn exactly those things that would give an examiner the impression that you knew more than you did."

**Psychological Torment**: The essay documents how children internalize irrational fears—Orwell once mistook "the Sixth Form" for a visitor's name, imagining terrifying beatings. Adults weaponized guilt and shame rather than addressing actual problems.

**Resilience Through Defiance**: Despite systematic cruelty, Orwell's account emphasizes how children possess an instinct to survive and maintain inner independence, even when outwardly conforming to oppressive systems.

The essay remains a powerful critique of how institutional brutality shapes childhood development.
