## Summary

Orwell's 1941 essay examines the cultural significance of cheap seaside postcards—particularly those by artist Donald McGill—that feature crude humor, exaggerated figures, and risqué jokes.

## Key Themes

**Subject Matter**: Orwell categorizes the postcards' humor into sex jokes, home life/henpecked husbands, drunkenness, and working-class satire. He notes that "more than half, perhaps three-quarters, of the jokes are sex jokes."

**Social Function**: The essay argues these postcards serve an important purpose—they express what Orwell calls the "Sancho Panza view of life," representing humanity's baser instincts that official society must suppress but cannot eliminate.

**Class Perspective**: Orwell observes the cards reflect working-class attitudes, particularly regarding aging, marriage, and accepting life's hardships earlier than upper classes do.

**Obscenity as Rebellion**: Rather than condemning their vulgarity, Orwell suggests obscene humor represents "a sort of mental rebellion" against society's rigid moral demands.

## Conclusion

Orwell defends these humble postcards as legitimate cultural expressions, arguing they deserve protection as a "harmless rebellion against virtue" that fulfills a genuine human need.
