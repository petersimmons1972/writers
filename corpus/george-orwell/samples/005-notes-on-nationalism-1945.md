**Date:** 1945
**Genre:** Political Essay
**Word Count:** ~8,000 words

## Core Definition

Orwell distinguishes nationalism from patriotism. While patriotism involves "devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life," nationalism represents "the habit of identifying oneself with a single nation or other unit, placing it beyond good and evil."

## Key Characteristics of Nationalist Thought

**Obsession**: Nationalists constantly emphasize their unit's superiority across military, cultural, linguistic, and even physical domains. They become "uneasily" reactive to perceived slights.

**Instability**: Nationalist loyalties transfer readily between objects—from countries to ideologies to imagined entities. A person may worship one nation intensely, then switch allegiance suddenly to another.

**Indifference to Reality**: Nationalists selectively ignore inconvenient facts. "Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them." Atrocities become acceptable when committed by "our side."

## Varieties Among English Intellectuals

Orwell categorizes nationalism into three groups:

- **Positive**: Neo-Toryism, Celtic nationalism, Zionism
- **Transferred**: Communism, Catholicism, color-based loyalty, class feeling, pacifism
- **Negative**: Anglophobia, antisemitism, Trotskyism

## Central Argument

Nationalism distorts judgment across political divides. The intelligentsia proved "more wrong about the progress of the war than the common people," demonstrating how emotional loyalty corrupts rational analysis. Orwell insists combating nationalism requires "a moral effort" to recognize one's biases while accepting objective reality.
