**Date:** November 9, 1945 (Tribune)

**Word Count:** ~2,000 words

## Summary

Orwell's essay reflects on witnessing the treatment of Nazi prisoners in post-war Germany. He describes observing a Viennese Jewish interrogator humiliate and kick a captured SS officer with deformed feet—a man likely responsible for concentration camp atrocities.

## Central Argument

Orwell contends that revenge, while psychologically satisfying in imagination, becomes hollow and pathetic once power shifts. He argues: "Revenge is an act which you want to commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also."

## Key Observations

The essay presents two supporting incidents:
1. The SS officer's humiliation, which paradoxically diminished rather than satisfied the desire for justice
2. A Belgian journalist's emotional transformation after witnessing a dead German soldier, which prompted compassion rather than vengeance

## Broader Message

Orwell critiques the Allied approach to post-war punishment, suggesting that crimes like expelling Germans from East Prussia stemmed from collective anger rather than genuine justice. He observes that public enthusiasm for punishing Nazi leaders wanes once they're imprisoned, implying that retribution-based peace settlements are fundamentally flawed.

The essay advocates for recognizing war's human toll over pursuing punitive satisfaction.
