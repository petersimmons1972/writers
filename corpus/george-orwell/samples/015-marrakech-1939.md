## Summary

Orwell's essay describes his observations in the Moroccan city of Marrakech, examining colonial attitudes and the invisibility of colonized peoples. The work explores several interconnected themes.

## Key Observations

The essay opens with a funeral scene, establishing how death and burial lack dignity in colonial settings. Orwell then reflects on how colonial systems depend on viewing indigenous populations as less than fully human: "the people have brown faces — besides, there are so many of them!"

He documents the crowded Jewish quarters, depicting workers in difficult conditions, and notes how antisemitic stereotypes persist despite evidence of poverty. He also reflects on the invisible labor of Moroccan peasants—how observers fail to notice the people themselves, only the landscape.

A memorable section describes elderly women carrying firewood, illustrating how their humanity becomes invisible beneath their burdens.

The essay concludes with Senegalese soldiers marching past, prompting Orwell to contemplate the psychological foundations of colonialism and its inherent fragility.
