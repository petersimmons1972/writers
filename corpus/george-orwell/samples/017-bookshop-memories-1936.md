## Summary

This essay chronicles Orwell's experience working in a second-hand bookshop, offering keen observations about customers, reading habits, and the book trade.

## Key Themes

**Customer Types**: Orwell describes the stereotypical patrons, including those seeking obscure titles they cannot remember, "dear old ladies" looking for birthday gifts, and individuals he identifies as "unmistakable paranoiacs" who order expensive books with no intention of payment.

**Reading Preferences**: The essay reveals surprising patterns in borrowing habits. As Orwell notes, "the one who 'went out' the best was...Ethel M. Dell," not canonical authors. He observes that classical Victorian novelists like Dickens and Austen rarely circulated, despite being easy to sell.

**The Business**: Orwell discusses the bookshop's sidelines—typewriters, stamps, horoscopes, and a lending library. He emphasizes that bookselling can be viable for educated entrepreneurs but involves "seventy-hour weeks" and unhealthy conditions.

**Personal Cost**: Most poignantly, Orwell confesses that working among books diminished his passion for them. The constant handling and dust, combined with lying about merchandise, created an aversion to what he once genuinely loved.

The essay concludes that despite the trade's humane qualities, he would not pursue it professionally.
