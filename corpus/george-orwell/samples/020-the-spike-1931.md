**Date:** April 1931 (Adelphi magazine)
**Genre:** Personal Reportage/Social Observation
**Word Count:** ~3,500 words

## Summary

"The Spike" is Orwell's firsthand account of spending a night in a workhouse casual ward. Originally published in *Adelphi* magazine in April 1931 under his birth name Eric Blair, it later formed the basis for chapters in *Down and Out in Paris and London*.

## Key Themes

**The Experience**: Orwell describes arriving with 48 other men and one woman, waiting to enter the spike. He captures the dehumanizing intake process—the search, forced bathing, and confiscation of possessions.

**Institutional Cruelty**: The narrative highlights systemic hardships: inadequate food, cold cells, and mandatory confinement. As Orwell notes, "boredom is the worst of all a tramp's evils, worse than hunger and discomfort."

**Class Commentary**: A particularly revealing moment occurs when Orwell discusses wasted food with a young carpenter-tramp. Despite sharing poverty, the carpenter distances himself from other tramps, revealing internalized class attitudes even among the desperate.

**Human Dignity**: The essay documents how institutions strip away dignity while showing moments of solidarity—like Scotty repaying Orwell's cigarette kindness upon release.

The work remains a powerful indictment of how societies treat their poorest members.
