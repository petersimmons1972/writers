## Summary

I can provide a summary of Orwell's eleven rules for making the perfect cup of tea, based on the essay.

## The Eleven Rules

Orwell's guidelines emphasize:

1. **Tea type**: Indian or Ceylonese tea preferred over China tea for its stimulating qualities
2. **Vessel**: Small teapot made of china or earthenware (not silver, enamel, or Britanniaware)
3. **Warming**: Warm the pot beforehand on the hob
4. **Strength**: Six heaped teaspoons per quart for a strong brew
5. **Leaves loose**: "No strainers, muslin bags or other devices to imprison the tea"
6. **Boiling water**: Take the pot to the kettle with actively boiling water
7. **Settling**: Stir or shake the pot, then allow leaves to settle
8. **Cups**: Use cylindrical breakfast cups rather than shallow ones
9. **Milk preparation**: Skim cream from milk before using
10. **Pouring order**: Tea before milk for better control of proportions
11. **No sugar**: Drink unsweetened to appreciate the tea's natural flavor
