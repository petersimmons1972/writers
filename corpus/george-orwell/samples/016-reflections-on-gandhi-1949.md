**Source:** https://www.orwell.ru/library/reviews/gandhi/english/e_gandhi
**Date:** January 1949 (Partisan Review) - Orwell's last published essay
**Genre:** Book Review Essay
**Word Count:** ~5,000 words

## Summary

Orwell's essay examines Gandhi's life and philosophy, published shortly after Gandhi's assassination. Rather than offering unqualified praise, Orwell applies critical scrutiny while acknowledging Gandhi's exceptional character.

## Key Arguments

**On Gandhi's Character:**
Orwell notes that Gandhi was "shrewd, able" and possessed "outstanding" physical courage. He was notably free from envy and suspicion, treating people across class and racial lines with equal respect. The essay emphasizes that Gandhi's early life included normal ambitions before gradually adopting his ascetic principles.

**On Religious vs. Humanistic Values:**
Orwell identifies a fundamental incompatibility between Gandhi's religious teachings and humanistic values. Gandhi's disciplines—vegetarianism, celibacy, rejection of close friendships—reflect an "other-worldly" orientation that Orwell sees as inhuman, arguing that "the essence of being human" includes willingness to commit ethical compromises for loyalty and love.

**On Pacifism and Politics:**
While respecting Gandhi's honest engagement with difficult questions, Orwell critiques the practicality of nonviolent resistance against totalitarian regimes lacking free press or assembly rights. He questions whether Gandhi's assumption that "all human beings are more or less approachable" holds universally.

## Conclusion

Despite personal aesthetic distance from Gandhi, Orwell concludes he left "a clean smell" as a politician—his methods achieved Indian independence without warfare, and his persistent, hatred-free struggle may have fundamentally changed Anglo-Indian relations.
