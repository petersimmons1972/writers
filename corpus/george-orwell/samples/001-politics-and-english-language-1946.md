**Word Count:** ~5,000 words

## Summary

George Orwell's 1946 essay argues that declining language quality and political corruption reinforce each other. He contends that while language decay has economic and political causes, "the process is reversible" through conscious effort.

## Main Arguments

**The Language-Thought Connection**
Orwell asserts that slovenly language makes foolish thinking easier, but improving writing clarity can aid "political regeneration." He emphasizes this isn't merely a concern for professional writers.

**Five Bad Writing Examples**
Orwell presents specimens exhibiting vagueness and staleness—from academic prose to political pamphlets—to illustrate modern English's characteristic flaws.

## Key Problems Identified

1. **Dying Metaphors**: Worn-out phrases like "toe the line" used without understanding their meaning

2. **Operators/Verbal False Limbs**: Inflated phrases replacing simple verbs (e.g., "render inoperative" instead of "break")

3. **Pretentious Diction**: Latin/Greek words masquerading as scientific objectivity; unnecessary foreign phrases

4. **Meaningless Words**: Terms like "romantic" or "democratic" employed without consistent meaning, often dishonestly

## Political Language

Orwell observes that political writing commonly employs euphemism to obscure brutal realities—calling bombing "pacification," forced displacement "transfer of population," and executions "elimination of unreliable elements."

## Six Rules for Better Writing

His practical guidance emphasizes: avoiding clichéd figures, preferring short words, eliminating unnecessary words, using active voice, avoiding jargon, and breaking rules rather than write "barbarously."

## Voice Characteristics
- Direct, conversational tone
- Concrete examples before abstract principles
- Self-aware about his own writing flaws
- Combines moral urgency with practical advice
- Uses numbered lists and clear structure
- Ends with actionable rules
