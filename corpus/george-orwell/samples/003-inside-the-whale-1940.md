## Complete Text

### Section I: Henry Miller and Tropic of Cancer

Orwell opens by discussing Henry Miller's *Tropic of Cancer* (1935), praising it despite—or perhaps because of—its controversial nature. He emphasizes that Miller captures the mundane reality of expatriate life in Paris during the 1920s, focusing on "bug-ridden rooms in working-men's hotels, of fights, drinking bouts, cheap brothels" and other gritty details most fiction avoids.

What distinguishes Miller's work, according to Orwell, is his willingness to present ordinary experience without sentimentality. The prose achieves what Joyce accomplished in *Ulysses*—"breaking down the solitude in which the human being lives" by demonstrating that one writer truly understands the reader's inner life.

Crucially, Orwell notes that Miller's attitude represents "acceptance" rather than protest. Unlike Céline, who wrote *Voyage au bout de la nuit* as "a cry of unbearable disgust," Miller finds himself "enjoying" despite poverty and degradation. This parallels Walt Whitman's democratic celebration of ordinary life, though Orwell argues the 1930s context makes such acceptance morally complex—one now accepts "concentration camps, rubber truncheons" and fascism alongside everyday existence.

### Section II: Literary History 1910-1940

Orwell traces twentieth-century English literary fashion through generational shifts:

**The Housman Era (1910-1925):** A. E. Housman dominated young readers with poems combining "country" nostalgia, adolescent themes of death and lost love, and implicit sexual and religious rebellion. His appeal lay in providing "wisdom" to schoolboys while subtly attacking Christian orthodoxy.

**The Joyce-Eliot Generation (1920s):** A new cohort—Joyce, Eliot, Lawrence, Pound, Wyndham Lewis, Huxley, Strachey—brought "pessimism of outlook." These writers shared "hostility to the notion of progress" and directed attention toward artistic, mythical, or psychological realms rather than contemporary politics. This reflected the comfort of the prosperous interwar years; "people with empty bellies never despair of the universe."

**The Auden-Spender Movement (1930s-1939):** Younger writers reversed course, embracing "serious purpose" and political engagement. They adopted Marxist perspectives and anti-Fascism, making "Communism" fashionable among intellectuals under forty. Orwell attributes this shift partly to middle-class unemployment and loss of traditional beliefs, partly to genuine ideological conviction. However, he criticizes their naïveté about totalitarianism: they could "swallow totalitarianism because they have no experience of anything except liberalism."

The 1930s proved disastrous for fiction specifically. Political orthodoxy, propaganda demands, and constant self-censorship ("Ought I to say this? Is it pro-Fascist?") made genuine novels nearly impossible. Orwell observes that "no decade in the past hundred and fifty years has been so barren of imaginative prose as the nineteen-thirties."

### Section III: Miller as Symptom and The Future of Literature

Orwell positions Miller as embodying a necessary counter-movement: complete non-engagement. Miller's "Jonah" figure—willing passivity inside the whale, accepting the world-process without attempting to control or improve it—represents what serious writing may require going forward.

The crucial argument: Western liberal civilization is collapsing into totalitarianism. Since "literature, in the form in which we know it, must suffer at least a temporary death," the autonomous individual writer faces obsolescence. Literature requires freedom of thought, mental honesty, and the liberal tradition—all disappearing.

Therefore, Orwell suggests, future worthwhile novels must follow Miller's model: recording experience without illusions of progress or control, accepting rather than protesting, remaining "innocent of public-spiritedness." The formula becomes: "admit you are inside the whale... simply accept it, endure it, record it."

Yet Orwell qualifies his assessment: Miller is "essentially a man of one book." *Tropic of Cancer* represents a singular achievement unlikely to be replicated. Nevertheless, its existence demonstrates that meaningful prose fiction remains possible despite the age's constraints—a vital demonstration of literature's resilience against totalizing forces.

The essay concludes with Orwell's wartime reflection (written 1940) that Miller's work, though admittedly "completely negative, unconstructive, amoral," carries profound symptom value: it proves major literature can emerge only when society fundamentally reshapes itself.
