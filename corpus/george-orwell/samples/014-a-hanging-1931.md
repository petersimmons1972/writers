## Summary

Orwell's essay documents a execution in Burma, presenting a firsthand account that transforms the reader's understanding of capital punishment through vivid, humanizing detail.

## Key Narrative Elements

The piece opens with stark imagery: "It was in Burma, a sodden morning of the rains. A sickly light, like yellow tinfoil, was slanting over the high walls into the jail yard."

The condemned prisoner is described as a "puny wisp of a man" who walks with steady composure toward his fate. The turning point arrives when Orwell observes the prisoner step aside to avoid a puddle—a small act that crystallizes his moral awakening.

Orwell writes that witnessing this gesture made him realize "what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man." The prisoner's biological functions continue operating—nails growing, organs functioning—even as his execution approaches.

## Disturbing Contrast

The essay's final section provides jarring counterpoint: after the execution, the officials and warders quickly return to casual conversation, laughter, and whisky. This tonal shift underscores society's psychological distance from the gravity of what transpired.

First published in *The Adelphi* (August 1931), this essay remains among Orwell's most morally penetrating works.
