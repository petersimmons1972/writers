**Word Count:** ~1,000 words

## Summary

Orwell's essay from *Tribune* explores why the term "Fascism" had become meaningless in contemporary discourse. He documents how the word was indiscriminately applied across the political spectrum—from Conservatives to Communists, pacifists to militarists, and nationalists of various stripes.

## Key Observations

Orwell notes that "as used, the word 'Fascism' is almost entirely meaningless," having been applied to everything from the Boy Scouts to astrology. Yet he acknowledges a buried emotional consensus: most English speakers associate Fascism with something "cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class."

## The Core Problem

While real political and economic differences existed between Fascist and democratic regimes, Orwell argues a precise definition remains elusive. He suggests this impossibility stems from unwillingness by Fascists, Conservatives, and Socialists alike to make certain admissions about the system.

## His Counsel

Rather than resolving the definitional crisis, Orwell recommends using "Fascism" cautiously and sparingly, avoiding its reduction to a mere epithet—a practice that had already become rampant by 1944.
