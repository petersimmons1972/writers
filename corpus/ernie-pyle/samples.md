# Ernie Pyle: Authentic Writing Samples and Style Analysis

## Overview

Ernest Taylor "Ernie" Pyle (1900-1945) was America's most beloved war correspondent during World War II. His syndicated column appeared in over 300 newspapers, reaching an estimated 14 million daily readers. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished War Correspondence in 1944. He was killed by Japanese machine gun fire on Ie Shima island on April 18, 1945.

Pyle's signature was the "worm's eye view" -- writing about war from the perspective of the ordinary enlisted man rather than from headquarters or strategy rooms. He lived with the soldiers, slept in their foxholes, ate their rations, and wrote about the war as they experienced it.

## Sample 1: "The Death of Captain Waskow" (January 10, 1944)

**Theater:** Italy | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** Italian Campaign

### Full Text

AT THE FRONT LINES IN ITALY, January 10, 1944 - In this war I have known a lot of officers who were loved and respected by the soldiers under them. But never have I crossed the trail of any man as beloved as Capt. Henry T. Waskow of Belton, Texas.

Capt. Waskow was a company commander in the 36th Division. He had led his company since long before it left the States. He was very young, only in his middle twenties, but he carried in him a sincerity and gentleness that made people want to be guided by him.

"After my own father, he came next," a sergeant told me.

"He always looked after us," a soldier said. "He'd go to bat for us every time."

"I've never knowed him to do anything unfair," another one said.

I was at the foot of the mule trail the night they brought Capt. Waskow's body down. The moon was nearly full at the time, and you could see far up the trail, and even part way across the valley below. Soldiers made shadows in the moonlight as they walked.

Dead men had been coming down the mountain all evening, lashed onto the backs of mules. They came lying belly-down across the wooden pack-saddles, their heads hanging down on the left side of the mule, their stiffened legs sticking out awkwardly from the other side, bobbing up and down as the mule walked.

The Italian mule-skinners were afraid to walk beside dead men, so Americans had to lead the mules down that night. Even the Americans were reluctant to unlash and lift off the bodies at the bottom, so an officer had to do it himself, and ask others to help.

The first one came early in the morning. They slid him down from the mule and stood him on his feet for a moment, while they got a new grip. In the half light he might have been merely a sick man standing there, leaning on the others. Then they laid him on the ground in the shadow of the low stone wall alongside the road.

I don't know who that first one was. You feel small in the presence of dead men, and ashamed at being alive, and you don't ask silly questions.

We left him there beside the road, that first one, and we all went back into the cowshed and sat on water cans or lay on the straw, waiting for the next batch of mules.

Somebody said the dead soldier had been dead for four days, and then nobody said anything more about it. We talked soldier talk for an hour or more. The dead man lay all alone outside in the shadow of the low stone wall.

Then a soldier came into the cowshed and said there were some more bodies outside. We went out into the road. Four mules stood there, in the moonlight, in the road where the trail came down off the mountain. The soldiers who led them stood there waiting. "This one is Captain Waskow," one of them said quietly.

Two men unlashed his body from the mule and lifted it off and laid it in the shadow beside the low stone wall. Other men took the other bodies off. Finally there were five lying end to end in a long row, alongside the road. You don't cover up dead men in the combat zone. They just lie there in the shadows until somebody else comes after them.

The unburdened mules moved off to their olive orchard. The men in the road seemed reluctant to leave. They stood around, and gradually one by one I could sense them moving close to Capt. Waskow's body. Not so much to look, I think, as to say something in finality to him, and to themselves. I stood close by and I could hear.

One soldier came and looked down, and he said out loud, "God damn it." That's all he said, and then he walked away. Another one came. He said, "God damn it to hell anyway." He looked down for a few last moments, and then he turned and left.

Another man came; I think he was an officer. It was hard to tell officers from men in the half light, for all were bearded and grimy dirty. The man looked down into the dead captain's face, and then he spoke directly to him, as though he were alive. He said: "I'm sorry, old man."

Then a soldier came and stood beside the officer, and bent over, and he too spoke to his dead captain, not in a whisper but awfully tenderly, and he said:

"I sure am sorry, sir."

Then the first man squatted down, and he reached down and took the dead hand, and he sat there for a full five minutes, holding the dead hand in his own and looking intently into the dead face, and he never uttered a sound all the time he sat there.

And finally he put the hand down, and then reached up and gently straightened the points of the captain's shirt collar, and then he sort of rearranged the tattered edges of his uniform around the wound. And then he got up and walked away down the road in the moonlight, all alone.

After that the rest of us went back into the cowshed, leaving the five dead men lying in a line, end to end, in the shadow of the low stone wall. We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep.

### Style Analysis

- **Structure:** Opens with general context, narrows to specific scene, builds chronologically to emotional climax
- **Sentence rhythm:** Mix of short declarative ("That's all he said") and longer compound sentences connected by "and"
- **Emotional register:** Restraint is the hallmark. The most powerful moments use the LEAST emotional language. "God damn it" carries more weight than any flowery description could.
- **First person:** "I" is present but as witness, not protagonist. "I stood close by and I could hear."
- **Physical detail:** Bodies "belly-down across the wooden pack-saddles, their heads hanging down on the left side of the mule, their stiffened legs sticking out awkwardly"
- **Key technique:** Lets action carry emotion. The man straightening the dead captain's collar says everything without Pyle needing to explain.
- **Ending:** Anticlimactic on purpose. They go back to sleep. War goes on. This is the most devastating technique -- normalizing the abnormal.

## Sample 2: "The God-Damned Infantry" (May 2, 1943)

**Theater:** North Africa (Tunisia) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** Tunisian Campaign

### Full Text

IN THE FRONT LINES BEFORE MATEUR, NORTHERN TUNISIA, May 2, 1943 -- We're now with an infantry outfit that has battled ceaselessly for four days and nights.

This northern warfare has been in the mountains. You don't ride much anymore. It is walking and climbing and crawling country. The mountains aren't big, but they are constant. They are largely treeless. They are easy to defend and bitter to take. But we are taking them.

The Germans lie on the back slope of every ridge, deeply dug into foxholes. In front of them the fields and pastures are hideous with thousands of hidden mines. The forward slopes are left open, untenanted, and if the Americans tried to scale these slopes they would be murdered wholesale in an inferno of machine-gun crossfire plus mortars and grenades.

Consequently we don't do it that way. We have fallen back to the old warfare of first pulverizing the enemy with artillery, then sweeping around the ends of the hill with infantry and taking them from the sides and behind.

I've written before how the big guns crack and roar almost constantly throughout the day and night. They lay a screen ahead of our troops. By magnificent shooting they drop shells on the back slopes. By means of shells timed to burst in the air a few feet from the ground, they get the Germans even in their foxholes. Our troops have found that the Germans dig foxholes down and then under, trying to get cover from the shell bursts that shower death from above.

Our artillery has really been sensational. For once we have enough of something and at the right time. Officers tell me they actually have more guns than they know what to do with.

All the guns in any one sector can be centered to shoot at one spot. And when we lay the whole business on a German hill the whole slope seems to erupt. It becomes an unbelievable cauldron of fire and smoke and dirt. Veteran German soldiers say they have never been through anything like it.

Now to the infantry -- the God-damned infantry, as they like to call themselves.

I love the infantry because they are the underdogs. They are the mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys. They have no comforts, and they even learn to live without the necessities. And in the end they are the guys that wars can't be won without.

I wish you could see just one of the ineradicable pictures I have in my mind today. In this particular picture I am sitting among clumps of sword-grass on a steep and rocky hillside that we have just taken. We are looking out over a vast rolling country to the rear.

A narrow path comes like a ribbon over a hill miles away, down a long slope, across a creek, up a slope and over another hill.

All along the length of this ribbon there is now a thin line of men. For four days and nights they have fought hard, eaten little, washed none, and slept hardly at all. Their nights have been violent with attack, fright, butchery, and their days sleepless and miserable with the crash of artillery.

The men are walking. They are fifty feet apart, for dispersal. Their walk is slow, for they are dead weary, as you can tell even when looking at them from behind. Every line and sag of their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaustion.

On their shoulders and backs they carry heavy steel tripods, machine-gun barrels, leaden boxes of ammunition. Their feet seem to sink into the ground from the overload they are bearing.

They don't slouch. It is the terrible deliberation of each step that spells out their appalling tiredness. Their faces are black and unshaven. They are young men, but the grime and whiskers and exhaustion make them look middle-aged.

In their eyes as they pass is not hatred, not excitement, not despair, not the tonic of their victory -- there is just the simple expression of being here as though they had been here doing this forever, and nothing else.

The line moves on, but it never ends. All afternoon men keep coming round the hill and vanishing eventually over the horizon. It is one long tired line of antlike men.

There is an agony in your heart and you almost feel ashamed to look at them. They are just guys from Broadway and Main Street, but you wouldn't remember them. They are too far away now. They are too tired. Their world can never be known to you, but if you could see them just once, just for an instant, you would know that no matter how hard people work back home they are not keeping pace with these infantrymen in Tunisia.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening technique:** Drops you right into the scene. "We're now with" -- present tense, immediate.
- **Terrain as character:** "The mountains aren't big, but they are constant." The landscape reflects the war.
- **Pivoting transition:** "Now to the infantry" -- shifts from tactical to emotional, the signature Pyle move.
- **Hyphenated compound:** "mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys" -- one of his most famous coinages. Creates a single concept from many discomforts.
- **Second person "you":** "You feel small... you don't ask silly questions." Pulls the reader INTO the scene.
- **Observation as poetry:** "Every line and sag of their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaustion." This is prose poetry disguised as journalism.
- **Scale shift:** From tactical artillery descriptions to "one long tired line of antlike men" -- zooms out to make the human cost visible.
- **Closing address:** Directly addresses the home-front reader: "you wouldn't remember them." Creates guilt without accusation.

## Sample 3: "The Horrible Waste of War" (June 16, 1944)

**Theater:** France (Normandy) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** D-Day aftermath

### Full Text

NORMANDY BEACHHEAD, June 16, 1944 -- I took a walk along the historic coast of Normandy in the country of France.

It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore. Men were sleeping on the sand, some of them sleeping forever. Men were floating in the water, but they didn't know they were in the water, for they were dead.

The water was full of squishy little jellyfish about the size of your hand. Millions of them. In the center each of them had a green design exactly like a four-leaf clover. The good-luck emblem. Sure. Hell yes.

I walked for a mile and a half along the water's edge of our many-miled invasion beach. You wanted to walk slowly, for the detail on that beach was infinite.

The wreckage was vast and startling. The awful waste and destruction of war, even aside from the loss of human life, has always been one of its outstanding features to those who are in it. Anything and everything is expendable. And we did expend on our beachhead in Normandy during those first few hours.

For a mile out from the beach there were scores of tanks and trucks and boats that you could no longer see, for they were at the bottom of the water -- swamped by overloading, or hit by shells, or sunk by mines. Most of their crews were lost.

You could see trucks tipped half over and swamped. You could see partly sunken barges, and the angled-up corners of jeeps, and small landing craft half submerged. And at low tide you could still see those vicious six-pronged iron snares that helped snag and wreck them.

On the beach itself, high and dry, were all kinds of wrecked vehicles. There were tanks that had only just made the beach before being knocked out. There were jeeps that had been burned to a dull gray. There were big derricks on caterpillar treads that didn't quite make it. There were half-tracks carrying office equipment that had been made into a shambles by a single shell hit, their interiors still holding their useless equipage of smashed typewriters, telephones, office files.

There were LCT's turned completely upside down, and lying on their backs, and how they got that way I don't know. There were boats stacked on top of each other, their sides caved in, their suspension doors knocked off.

In this shoreline museum of carnage there were abandoned rolls of barbed wire and smashed bulldozers and big stacks of thrown-away lifebelts and piles of shells still waiting to be moved.

In the water floated empty life rafts and soldiers' packs and ration boxes, and mysterious oranges.

On the beach lay snarled rolls of telephone wire and big rolls of steel matting and stacks of broken, rusting rifles.

On the beach lay, expended, sufficient men and mechanism for a small war. They were gone forever now. And yet we could afford it.

We could afford it because we were on, we had our toehold, and behind us there were such enormous replacements for this wreckage on the beach that you could hardly conceive of their sum total. Men and equipment were flowing from England in such a gigantic stream that it made the waste on the beachhead seem like nothing at all, really nothing at all.

A few hundred yards back on the beach is a high bluff. Up there we had a tent hospital, and a barbed-wire enclosure for prisoners of war. From up there you could see far up and down the beach, in a spectacular crow's-nest view, and far out to sea.

And standing out there on the water beyond all this wreckage was the greatest armada man has ever seen. You simply could not believe the gigantic collection of ships that lay out there waiting to unload.

Looking from the bluff, it lay thick and clear to the far horizon of the sea and beyond, and it spread out to the sides and was miles wide. Its utter enormity would move the hardest man.

As I stood up there I noticed a group of freshly taken German prisoners standing nearby. They had not yet been put in the prison cage. They were just standing there, a couple of doughboys leisurely guarding them with tommy guns.

The prisoners too were looking out to sea -- the same bit of sea that for months and years had been so safely empty before their gaze. Now they stood staring almost as if in a trance.

They didn't say a word to each other. They didn't need to. The expression on their faces was something forever unforgettable. In it was the final horrified acceptance of their doom.

If only all Germans could have had the rich experience of standing on the bluff and looking out across the water and seeing what their compatriots saw.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening irony:** "It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore." Then immediately: dead men. This ironic juxtaposition is a Pyle signature.
- **Fragment as emphasis:** "Sure. Hell yes." Three words that carry the bitterness of the entire war.
- **Catalog technique:** Long lists of wreckage ("socks and shoe polish, sewing kits, diaries, Bibles and hand grenades"). The mixing of mundane and lethal items is the point.
- **Anaphora:** "There were... There were... There were..." -- repetition creates a rhythm of overwhelming accumulation.
- **Tonal pivot:** Moves from wreckage to the armada, from waste to might. "Its utter enormity would move the hardest man."
- **Closing power:** Ends not with Americans but with German prisoners looking at the armada. Ironic reversal of perspective.
- **Physical specificity:** "squishy little jellyfish about the size of your hand" -- sensory detail even amid horror.

## Sample 4: "A Long Thin Line of Personal Anguish" (June 17, 1944)

**Theater:** France (Normandy) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** D-Day aftermath

### Full Text

NORMANDY BEACHHEAD, June 17, 1944 -- In the preceding column we told about the D-day wreckage among our machines of war that were expended in taking one of the Normandy beaches.

But there is another and more human litter. It extends in a thin little line, just like a high-water mark, for miles along the beach. This is the strewn personal gear, gear that will never be needed again, of those who fought and died to give us our entrance into Europe.

Here in a jumbled row for mile on mile are soldiers' packs. Here are socks and shoe polish, sewing kits, diaries, Bibles and hand grenades. Here are the latest letters from home, with the address on each one neatly razored out -- one of the security precautions enforced before the boys embarked.

Here are toothbrushes and razors, and snapshots of families back home staring up at you from the sand. Here are pocketbooks, metal mirrors, extra trousers, and bloody, abandoned shoes. Here are broken-handled shovels, and portable radios smashed almost beyond recognition, and mine detectors twisted and ruined.

Here are torn pistol belts and canvas water buckets, first-aid kits and jumbled heaps of lifebelts. I picked up a pocket Bible with a soldier's name in it, and put it in my jacket. I carried it half a mile or so and then put it back down on the beach. I don't know why I picked it up, or why I put it back down.

Soldiers carry strange things ashore with them. In every invasion you'll find at least one soldier hitting the beach at H-hour with a banjo slung over his shoulder. The most ironic piece of equipment marking our beach -- this beach of first despair, then victory -- is a tennis racket that some soldier had brought along. It lies lonesomely on the sand, clamped in its rack, not a string broken.

Two of the most dominant items in the beach refuse are cigarets and writing paper. Each soldier was issued a carton of cigarets just before he started. Today these cartons by the thousand, water-soaked and spilled out, mark the line of our first savage blow.

Writing paper and air-mail envelopes come second. The boys had intended to do a lot of writing in France. Letters that would have filled those blank, abandoned pages.

Always there are dogs in every invasion. There is a dog still on the beach today, still pitifully looking for his masters.

He stays at the water's edge, near a boat that lies twisted and half sunk at the water line. He barks appealingly to every soldier who approaches, trots eagerly along with him for a few feet, and then, sensing himself unwanted in all this haste, runs back to wait in vain for his own people at his own empty boat.

Over and around this long thin line of personal anguish, fresh men today are rushing vast supplies to keep our armies pushing on into France. Other squads of men pick amidst the wreckage to salvage ammunition and equipment that are still usable.

Men worked and slept on the beach for days before the last D-day victim was taken away for burial.

I stepped over the form of one youngster whom I thought dead. But when I looked down I saw he was only sleeping. He was very young, and very tired. He lay on one elbow, his hand suspended in the air about six inches from the ground. And in the palm of his hand he held a large, smooth rock.

I stood and looked at him a long time. He seemed in his sleep to hold that rock lovingly, as though it were his last link with a vanishing world. I have no idea at all why he went to sleep with the rock in his hand, or what kept him from dropping it once he was asleep. It was just one of those little things without explanation that a person remembers for a long time.

The strong, swirling tides of the Normandy coastline shift the contours of the sandy beach as they move in and out. They carry soldiers' bodies out to sea, and later they return them. They cover the corpses of heroes with sand, and then in their whims they uncover them.

As I plowed out over the wet sand of the beach on that first day ashore, I walked around what seemed to be a couple of pieces of driftwood sticking out of the sand. But they weren't driftwood.

They were a soldier's two feet. He was completely covered by the shifting sands except for his feet. The toes of his GI shoes pointed toward the land he had come so far to see, and which he saw so briefly.

### Style Analysis

- **Transition from companion piece:** "In the preceding column..." -- Pyle often wrote multi-part dispatches, each narrowing focus.
- **Anaphora:** "Here are... Here are... Here are..." -- relentless inventory that builds emotional weight.
- **Personal intrusion:** "I picked up a pocket Bible... I don't know why I picked it up, or why I put it back down." This is Pyle inserting confusion and honesty. He doesn't pretend to understand everything.
- **The dog:** An entire paragraph on a lost dog. This is quintessential Pyle -- finding the universal in the specific, the unbearable in the small detail.
- **The sleeping soldier with the rock:** Extended observation that leads to admitted mystery. "I have no idea at all why" -- Pyle embraces not-knowing.
- **Closing image:** "The toes of his GI shoes pointed toward the land he had come so far to see, and which he saw so briefly." One of the most devastating closing lines in war journalism. Simple, concrete, final.
- **Fragment as grief:** "Letters that would have filled those blank, abandoned pages." A sentence fragment that says more by stopping.

## Sample 5: "A Dreadful Masterpiece" (December 30, 1940)

**Theater:** London (pre-US entry) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** London Blitz

### Full Text

LONDON, December 30, 1940 -- Someday when peace has returned to this odd world I want to come to London again and stand on a certain balcony on a moonlit night and look down upon the peaceful silver curve of the Thames with its dark bridges.

And standing there, I want to tell somebody who has never seen it how London looked on a certain night in the holiday season of the year 1940.

For on that night this old, old city -- even though I must bite my tongue in shame for saying it -- was the most beautiful sight I have ever seen.

It was a night when London was ringed and stabbed with fire.

They came just after dark, and somehow I could sense from the quick, bitter firing of the guns that there was to be no monkey business this night.

Shortly after the sirens wailed I could hear the Germans grinding overhead. In my room, with its black curtains drawn across the windows, you could feel the shake from the guns. You could hear the boom, crump, crump, crump, of heavy bombs at their work of tearing buildings apart. They were not too far away.

Half an hour after the firing started I gathered a couple of friends and went to a high, darkened balcony that gave us a view of one-third of the entire circle of London.

As we stepped out onto the balcony a vast inner excitement came over all of us -- an excitement that had neither fear nor horror in it, because it was too full of awe.

You have all seen big fires, but I doubt if you have ever seen the whole horizon of a city lined with great fires -- scores of them, perhaps hundreds.

The closest fires were near enough for us to hear the crackling flames and the yells of firemen. Little fires grew into big ones even as we watched. Big ones died down under the firemen's valor only to break out again later.

About every two minutes a new wave of planes would be over. The motors seemed to grind rather than roar, and to have an angry pulsation like a bee buzzing in blind fury.

The bombs did not make a constant overwhelming din as in those terrible days of last September. They were intermittent -- sometimes a few seconds apart, sometimes a minute or more.

Their sound was sharp, when nearby, and soft and muffled, far away.

Into the dark, shadowed spaces below us, as we watched, whole batches of incendiary bombs fell. We saw two dozen go off in two seconds. They flashed terrifically, then quickly simmered down to pinpoints of dazzling white, burning ferociously.

These white pinpoints would go out one by one as the unseen heroes of the moment smothered them with sand. But also, as we watched, other pinpoints would burn on and pretty soon a yellow flame would leap up from the white center. They had done their work -- another building was on fire.

The greatest of all the fires was directly in front of us. Flames seemed to whip hundreds of feet into the air. Pinkish-white smoke ballooned upward in a great cloud, and out of this cloud there gradually took shape -- so faintly at first that we weren't sure we saw correctly -- the gigantic dome and spires of St. Paul's Cathedral.

St. Paul's was surrounded by fire, but it came through. It stood there in its enormous proportions -- growing slowly clearer and clearer, the way objects take shape at dawn. It was like a picture of some miraculous figure that appears before peace-hungry soldiers on a battlefield. The streets below us were semi-illuminated from the glow.

Immediately above the fires the sky was red and angry, and overhead, making a ceiling in the vast heavens, there was a cloud of smoke all in pink. Up in that pink shrouding there were tiny, brilliant specks of flashing light -- anti-aircraft shells bursting. After the flash you could hear the sound.

Up there, too, the barrage balloons were standing out as clearly as if it were daytime, but now they were pink instead of silver. And now and then through a hole in that pink shroud there twinkled incongruously a permanent, genuine star -- the old-fashioned kind that has always been there.

Below us the Thames grew lighter, and all around below were the shadows -- the dark shadows of buildings and bridges that formed the base of this dreadful masterpiece.

Later on I borrowed a tin hat and went out among the fires. That was exciting too, but the thing I shall always remember above all the other things in my life is the monstrous loveliness of that one single view of London on a holiday night -- London stabbed with great fires, shaken by explosions, its dark regions along the Thames sparkling with the pinpoints of white-hot bombs, all of it roofed over with a ceiling of pink that held bursting shells, balloons, flares and the grind of vicious engines. And in yourself the excitement and anticipation and wonder in your soul that this could be happening at all.

These things all went together to make the most hateful, most beautiful single scene I have ever known.

### Style Analysis

- **Frame technique:** Opens in the future, looking back. "Someday when peace has returned..." This creates nostalgia for a moment not yet past.
- **Confession:** "even though I must bite my tongue in shame for saying it" -- honest admission that destruction can be beautiful. This moral complexity is central to Pyle.
- **Onomatopoeia:** "boom, crump, crump, crump" -- the sounds of war rendered in words.
- **Color palette:** Pink, red, white, silver, dark. Pyle paints this like an artist, not a reporter.
- **The star:** "through a hole in that pink shroud there twinkled incongruously a permanent, genuine star -- the old-fashioned kind that has always been there." This detail grounds the apocalypse in the eternal.
- **Oxymoron closing:** "most hateful, most beautiful" -- the piece resolves on irreconcilable tension. Pyle does not pretend war makes sense.
- **Pre-war Pyle:** This is travel-column Pyle meeting war-correspondent Pyle. More lyrical, more painterly than his later infantry dispatches.

## Sample 6: "On Victory in Europe" (April 1945 -- Last Column)

**Theater:** Pacific (Okinawa) | **Source:** Found in Pyle's pocket after his death on Ie Shima | **Period:** Final dispatch

### Full Text

And so it is over. The catastrophe on one side of the world has run its course. The day that it had so long seemed would never come has come at last. I suppose our emotions here in the Pacific are the same as they were among Allies all over the world. First a shouting of the good news with such joyous surprise that you would think the shouter himself had brought it about.

And then an unspoken sense of gigantic relief -- and then a hope that the collapse in Europe would hasten the end in the Pacific.

It has been seven months since I heard my last shot in the European War. Now I am as far away from it as it is possible to get on this globe.

This is written on a little ship lying off the coast of the Island of Okinawa, just south of Japan, on the other side of the world from Ardennes.

But my heart is still in Europe, and that's why I am writing this column.

It is to the boys who were my friends for so long. My one regret of the war is that I was not with them when it ended.

For the companionship of two and a half years of death and misery is a spouse that tolerates no divorce. Such companionship finally becomes a part of one's soul, and it cannot be obliterated.

True, I am with American boys in the other war not yet ended, but I am old-fashioned and my sentiment runs to old things.

To me the European War is old, and the Pacific War is new.

Last summer I wrote that I hoped the end of the war could be a gigantic relief, but not an elation. In the joyousness of high spirits it is so easy for us to forget the dead. Those who are gone would not wish themselves to be a millstone of gloom around our necks.

But there are so many of the living who have had burned into their brains forever the unnatural sight of cold dead men scattered over the hillsides and in the ditches along the high rows of hedge throughout the world.

Dead men by mass production -- in one country after another -- month after month and year after year. Dead men in winter and dead men in summer.

Dead men in such familiar promiscuity that they become monotonous.

Dead men in such monstrous infinity that you come almost to hate them.

Those are the things that you at home need not even try to understand. To you at home they are columns of figures, or he is a near one who went away and just didn't come back. You didn't see him lying so grotesque and pasty beside the gravel road in France.

We saw him, saw him by the multiple thousands. That's the difference.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening simplicity:** "And so it is over." Five words. The weight is in the understatement.
- **Geographic grounding:** Pyle always tells you exactly where he is. "a little ship lying off the coast of the Island of Okinawa."
- **Marriage metaphor:** "the companionship of two and a half years of death and misery is a spouse that tolerates no divorce." Unusually literary for Pyle.
- **Anaphora of death:** "Dead men by mass production... Dead men in winter... Dead men in such familiar promiscuity... Dead men in such monstrous infinity..." The repetition creates numbing, which IS the point.
- **The confrontation:** "You didn't see him lying so grotesque and pasty beside the gravel road in France." Direct accusation of the home front's ignorance.
- **Final line:** "We saw him, saw him by the multiple thousands. That's the difference." The repetition of "saw him" carries all the exhaustion.
- **Unfinished:** Found in his pocket. The column is complete enough to publish, but there's a raw quality -- as if Pyle's editor (death) stopped him mid-thought.

## Sample 7: Anzio Dispatches (February-April 1944)

**Theater:** Italy (Anzio Beachhead) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** Anzio Campaign

### Key Passages

"When you get to Anzio, you waste no time getting off the boat, for you have been feeling pretty much like a clay pigeon in a shooting gallery."

"After a few hours in Anzio, you wish you were back on the boat, for you could hardly describe being ashore as any haven of peacefulness."

"This is a new kind of warfare for us. Here, distances are short, and space is confined. The whole beachhead is the front line."

"Men have dug underground and built themselves homes."

"It's a look of dullness -- eyes that look without seeing, eyes that see without transferring any response to the mind."

"When our bombing was over, my room was in shambles. It was the sort of thing you see only in the movies."

"There has been some exhilaration here and some fun, along with the misery and the sadness."

"It must be an awful thing to go up to the brink of possible death in the nighttime in a faraway land, puzzled and afraid, knowing no one."

### Style Analysis

- **Immediate address:** "When you get to Anzio" -- second person pulls reader in instantly.
- **Ironic understatement:** "you could hardly describe being ashore as any haven of peacefulness" -- classic Pyle litotes.
- **Clinical description of trauma:** "eyes that look without seeing, eyes that see without transferring any response to the mind" -- describing what we now call PTSD.
- **The small and the large:** Juxtaposes movie references with death, exhilaration with sadness.
- **Closing empathy:** "puzzled and afraid, knowing no one" -- these adjectives humanize the soldier completely.

## Sample 8: Letters from the Front (1944)

**Source:** Personal correspondence, published posthumously | **Period:** Late winter/early spring 1944

### Key Passages

"I've got so I brood about it, about the whole thing, I mean, and I have a personal reluctance to die that is always in my mind, like a weight. Instead of growing stronger and hard as good veterans do, I've become weaker and more frightened. I'm allright when I'm actually at the front, but it's when I pull back and start thinking and visualizing that it almost overwhelms me."

"I've been pretty low for a month and a half. Have felt so damn lousy, and no word from Jerry."

"If I can just see the European war out, I think I might feel justified in quitting the war."

"There's such a thing as pressing your luck too far in one spot."

### Style Analysis

- **Vulnerability:** In private letters, Pyle drops all pretense. "I've become weaker and more frightened" is the opposite of his public courage.
- **Colloquial honesty:** "so damn lousy" -- the same plain language of his columns, but turned inward.
- **Self-awareness:** He recognizes his own mental deterioration. The distinction between "actually at the front" (manageable) and "thinking and visualizing" (overwhelming) is precise trauma description.
- **Fatalism:** "pressing your luck too far" -- Pyle died five months later.

## Common Patterns Across All Samples

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length:** Medium. Neither consistently short nor long. The variation IS the rhythm.
- **Fragments used sparingly but powerfully:** "Sure. Hell yes." / "Dead men in summer."
- **Compound sentences joined by "and":** His most powerful sentences chain clauses with "and" rather than subordinating them. "And then he got up and walked away down the road in the moonlight, all alone."
- **Short declaratives for emphasis:** "That's all he said." / "That's the difference." / "They were not driftwood."

### Paragraph Organization
- **One-sentence paragraphs for impact:** "It was a night when London was ringed and stabbed with fire."
- **Catalog paragraphs:** Long lists of observed items, each anchored by "Here are" or "There were."
- **Transition paragraphs:** Short bridges between scenes. "Then a soldier came into the cowshed and said there were some more bodies outside."

### Transition Styles
- **Temporal:** "Then... And then... After that..." -- simple chronological progression.
- **No formal transitions:** Pyle often just jumps. New paragraph, new scene. No "Meanwhile" or "In contrast."
- **Pivot sentences:** "Now to the infantry" -- a single sentence shifts the entire piece's focus.

### Voice Quirks and Repeated Phrases
- **"I don't know"** -- admitted frequently. Pyle embraces ignorance.
- **"You"** -- constant second-person address pulling reader into the scene.
- **"the boys"** -- his consistent term for soldiers. Never "troops" in emotional passages, rarely "men."
- **"sort of"** and "kind of"** -- deliberate imprecision that sounds like speech.
- **"I think"** and "I suppose"** -- hedging that creates intimacy and honesty.
- **Colloquial insertions:** "Sure. Hell yes." / "God damn it."

### Opening Patterns
- **Dateline + immediate scene:** "We're now with an infantry outfit..."
- **Simple declarative:** "And so it is over."
- **Ironic setup:** "It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore."
- **Future-looking frame:** "Someday when peace has returned..."

### Closing Patterns
- **Image that crystallizes meaning:** Soldier's feet pointing toward France. Man walking alone in moonlight.
- **Deliberate anticlimax:** "We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep."
- **Direct address to reader:** "if you could see them just once..."
- **Single devastating sentence:** "That's the difference."

### Punctuation Patterns
- **Em-dashes:** Used moderately for parenthetical asides. "even though I must bite my tongue in shame for saying it --"
- **Ellipses:** Almost never. Pyle does not trail off. He stops.
- **Periods:** His primary tool. Short sentences. Declarative stops.
- **Commas in compound sentences:** Heavy use of "and" + comma: "and he sat there for a full five minutes, holding the dead hand"

### Tone and Emotional Register
- **Understated grief:** The most powerful moments are the quietest.
- **Never sentimental:** Pyle avoids exclamation points, avoids telling you what to feel.
- **Moral complexity:** Admits beauty in destruction, hatred of the dead, shame at survival.
- **Everyman voice:** Writes as though talking to a neighbor. No jargon, no literary pretension.
- **Anger beneath calm:** The fury surfaces in fragments. "Sure. Hell yes." "God damn it to hell anyway."

### Distinctive Markers That Make Pyle Recognizable
1. **Second-person "you" pulling reader into foxhole**
2. **Concrete physical detail of the small and mundane** (sewing kits, toothbrushes, shoe polish)
3. **Soldiers as named or described individuals**, not abstract "forces"
4. **Admitted ignorance and confusion** ("I don't know why I picked it up")
5. **One-sentence paragraphs for maximum impact**
6. **Compound "and" chains** building to emotional peaks
7. **Closing images that stop the breath**
8. **Colloquial language** -- writes the way humans talk
9. **The pivot from tactical to emotional** in a single transition
10. **Anticlimax as devastation** -- going back to sleep after witnessing death
