# Ernie Pyle: Authentic Writing Samples and Style Analysis

## Overview

Ernest Taylor "Ernie" Pyle (1900-1945) was America's most beloved war correspondent during World War II. His syndicated column appeared in over 300 newspapers, reaching an estimated 14 million daily readers. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished War Correspondence in 1944. He was killed by Japanese machine gun fire on Ie Shima island on April 18, 1945.

Pyle's signature was the "worm's eye view" -- writing about war from the perspective of the ordinary enlisted man rather than from headquarters or strategy rooms. He lived with the soldiers, slept in their foxholes, ate their rations, and wrote about the war as they experienced it.

## Sample 1: "The Death of Captain Waskow" (January 10, 1944)

**Theater:** Italy | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** Italian Campaign

### Full Text

AT THE FRONT LINES IN ITALY, January 10, 1944 - In this war I have known a lot of officers who were loved and respected by the soldiers under them. But never have I crossed the trail of any man as beloved as Capt. Henry T. Waskow of Belton, Texas.

Capt. Waskow was a company commander in the 36th Division. He had led his company since long before it left the States. He was very young, only in his middle twenties, but he carried in him a sincerity and gentleness that made people want to be guided by him.

"After my own father, he came next," a sergeant told me.

"He always looked after us," a soldier said. "He'd go to bat for us every time."

"I've never knowed him to do anything unfair," another one said.

I was at the foot of the mule trail the night they brought Capt. Waskow's body down. The moon was nearly full at the time, and you could see far up the trail, and even part way across the valley below. Soldiers made shadows in the moonlight as they walked.

Dead men had been coming down the mountain all evening, lashed onto the backs of mules. They came lying belly-down across the wooden pack-saddles, their heads hanging down on the left side of the mule, their stiffened legs sticking out awkwardly from the other side, bobbing up and down as the mule walked.

The Italian mule-skinners were afraid to walk beside dead men, so Americans had to lead the mules down that night. Even the Americans were reluctant to unlash and lift off the bodies at the bottom, so an officer had to do it himself, and ask others to help.

The first one came early in the morning. They slid him down from the mule and stood him on his feet for a moment, while they got a new grip. In the half light he might have been merely a sick man standing there, leaning on the others. Then they laid him on the ground in the shadow of the low stone wall alongside the road.

I don't know who that first one was. You feel small in the presence of dead men, and ashamed at being alive, and you don't ask silly questions.

We left him there beside the road, that first one, and we all went back into the cowshed and sat on water cans or lay on the straw, waiting for the next batch of mules.

Somebody said the dead soldier had been dead for four days, and then nobody said anything more about it. We talked soldier talk for an hour or more. The dead man lay all alone outside in the shadow of the low stone wall.

Then a soldier came into the cowshed and said there were some more bodies outside. We went out into the road. Four mules stood there, in the moonlight, in the road where the trail came down off the mountain. The soldiers who led them stood there waiting. "This one is Captain Waskow," one of them said quietly.

Two men unlashed his body from the mule and lifted it off and laid it in the shadow beside the low stone wall. Other men took the other bodies off. Finally there were five lying end to end in a long row, alongside the road. You don't cover up dead men in the combat zone. They just lie there in the shadows until somebody else comes after them.

The unburdened mules moved off to their olive orchard. The men in the road seemed reluctant to leave. They stood around, and gradually one by one I could sense them moving close to Capt. Waskow's body. Not so much to look, I think, as to say something in finality to him, and to themselves. I stood close by and I could hear.

One soldier came and looked down, and he said out loud, "God damn it." That's all he said, and then he walked away. Another one came. He said, "God damn it to hell anyway." He looked down for a few last moments, and then he turned and left.

Another man came; I think he was an officer. It was hard to tell officers from men in the half light, for all were bearded and grimy dirty. The man looked down into the dead captain's face, and then he spoke directly to him, as though he were alive. He said: "I'm sorry, old man."

Then a soldier came and stood beside the officer, and bent over, and he too spoke to his dead captain, not in a whisper but awfully tenderly, and he said:

"I sure am sorry, sir."

Then the first man squatted down, and he reached down and took the dead hand, and he sat there for a full five minutes, holding the dead hand in his own and looking intently into the dead face, and he never uttered a sound all the time he sat there.

And finally he put the hand down, and then reached up and gently straightened the points of the captain's shirt collar, and then he sort of rearranged the tattered edges of his uniform around the wound. And then he got up and walked away down the road in the moonlight, all alone.

After that the rest of us went back into the cowshed, leaving the five dead men lying in a line, end to end, in the shadow of the low stone wall. We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep.

### Style Analysis

- **Structure:** Opens with general context, narrows to specific scene, builds chronologically to emotional climax
- **Sentence rhythm:** Mix of short declarative ("That's all he said") and longer compound sentences connected by "and"
- **Emotional register:** Restraint is the hallmark. The most powerful moments use the LEAST emotional language. "God damn it" carries more weight than any flowery description could.
- **First person:** "I" is present but as witness, not protagonist. "I stood close by and I could hear."
- **Physical detail:** Bodies "belly-down across the wooden pack-saddles, their heads hanging down on the left side of the mule, their stiffened legs sticking out awkwardly"
- **Key technique:** Lets action carry emotion. The man straightening the dead captain's collar says everything without Pyle needing to explain.
- **Ending:** Anticlimactic on purpose. They go back to sleep. War goes on. This is the most devastating technique -- normalizing the abnormal.

## Sample 2: "The God-Damned Infantry" (May 2, 1943)

**Theater:** North Africa (Tunisia) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** Tunisian Campaign

### Full Text

IN THE FRONT LINES BEFORE MATEUR, NORTHERN TUNISIA, May 2, 1943 -- We're now with an infantry outfit that has battled ceaselessly for four days and nights.

This northern warfare has been in the mountains. You don't ride much anymore. It is walking and climbing and crawling country. The mountains aren't big, but they are constant. They are largely treeless. They are easy to defend and bitter to take. But we are taking them.

The Germans lie on the back slope of every ridge, deeply dug into foxholes. In front of them the fields and pastures are hideous with thousands of hidden mines. The forward slopes are left open, untenanted, and if the Americans tried to scale these slopes they would be murdered wholesale in an inferno of machine-gun crossfire plus mortars and grenades.

Consequently we don't do it that way. We have fallen back to the old warfare of first pulverizing the enemy with artillery, then sweeping around the ends of the hill with infantry and taking them from the sides and behind.

I've written before how the big guns crack and roar almost constantly throughout the day and night. They lay a screen ahead of our troops. By magnificent shooting they drop shells on the back slopes. By means of shells timed to burst in the air a few feet from the ground, they get the Germans even in their foxholes. Our troops have found that the Germans dig foxholes down and then under, trying to get cover from the shell bursts that shower death from above.

Our artillery has really been sensational. For once we have enough of something and at the right time. Officers tell me they actually have more guns than they know what to do with.

All the guns in any one sector can be centered to shoot at one spot. And when we lay the whole business on a German hill the whole slope seems to erupt. It becomes an unbelievable cauldron of fire and smoke and dirt. Veteran German soldiers say they have never been through anything like it.

Now to the infantry -- the God-damned infantry, as they like to call themselves.

I love the infantry because they are the underdogs. They are the mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys. They have no comforts, and they even learn to live without the necessities. And in the end they are the guys that wars can't be won without.

I wish you could see just one of the ineradicable pictures I have in my mind today. In this particular picture I am sitting among clumps of sword-grass on a steep and rocky hillside that we have just taken. We are looking out over a vast rolling country to the rear.

A narrow path comes like a ribbon over a hill miles away, down a long slope, across a creek, up a slope and over another hill.

All along the length of this ribbon there is now a thin line of men. For four days and nights they have fought hard, eaten little, washed none, and slept hardly at all. Their nights have been violent with attack, fright, butchery, and their days sleepless and miserable with the crash of artillery.

The men are walking. They are fifty feet apart, for dispersal. Their walk is slow, for they are dead weary, as you can tell even when looking at them from behind. Every line and sag of their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaustion.

On their shoulders and backs they carry heavy steel tripods, machine-gun barrels, leaden boxes of ammunition. Their feet seem to sink into the ground from the overload they are bearing.

They don't slouch. It is the terrible deliberation of each step that spells out their appalling tiredness. Their faces are black and unshaven. They are young men, but the grime and whiskers and exhaustion make them look middle-aged.

In their eyes as they pass is not hatred, not excitement, not despair, not the tonic of their victory -- there is just the simple expression of being here as though they had been here doing this forever, and nothing else.

The line moves on, but it never ends. All afternoon men keep coming round the hill and vanishing eventually over the horizon. It is one long tired line of antlike men.

There is an agony in your heart and you almost feel ashamed to look at them. They are just guys from Broadway and Main Street, but you wouldn't remember them. They are too far away now. They are too tired. Their world can never be known to you, but if you could see them just once, just for an instant, you would know that no matter how hard people work back home they are not keeping pace with these infantrymen in Tunisia.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening technique:** Drops you right into the scene. "We're now with" -- present tense, immediate.
- **Terrain as character:** "The mountains aren't big, but they are constant." The landscape reflects the war.
- **Pivoting transition:** "Now to the infantry" -- shifts from tactical to emotional, the signature Pyle move.
- **Hyphenated compound:** "mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys" -- one of his most famous coinages. Creates a single concept from many discomforts.
- **Second person "you":** "You feel small... you don't ask silly questions." Pulls the reader INTO the scene.
- **Observation as poetry:** "Every line and sag of their bodies speaks their inhuman exhaustion." This is prose poetry disguised as journalism.
- **Scale shift:** From tactical artillery descriptions to "one long tired line of antlike men" -- zooms out to make the human cost visible.
- **Closing address:** Directly addresses the home-front reader: "you wouldn't remember them." Creates guilt without accusation.

## Sample 3: "The Horrible Waste of War" (June 16, 1944)

**Theater:** France (Normandy) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** D-Day aftermath

### Full Text

NORMANDY BEACHHEAD, June 16, 1944 -- I took a walk along the historic coast of Normandy in the country of France.

It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore. Men were sleeping on the sand, some of them sleeping forever. Men were floating in the water, but they didn't know they were in the water, for they were dead.

The water was full of squishy little jellyfish about the size of your hand. Millions of them. In the center each of them had a green design exactly like a four-leaf clover. The good-luck emblem. Sure. Hell yes.

I walked for a mile and a half along the water's edge of our many-miled invasion beach. You wanted to walk slowly, for the detail on that beach was infinite.

The wreckage was vast and startling. The awful waste and destruction of war, even aside from the loss of human life, has always been one of its outstanding features to those who are in it. Anything and everything is expendable. And we did expend on our beachhead in Normandy during those first few hours.

For a mile out from the beach there were scores of tanks and trucks and boats that you could no longer see, for they were at the bottom of the water -- swamped by overloading, or hit by shells, or sunk by mines. Most of their crews were lost.

You could see trucks tipped half over and swamped. You could see partly sunken barges, and the angled-up corners of jeeps, and small landing craft half submerged. And at low tide you could still see those vicious six-pronged iron snares that helped snag and wreck them.

On the beach itself, high and dry, were all kinds of wrecked vehicles. There were tanks that had only just made the beach before being knocked out. There were jeeps that had been burned to a dull gray. There were big derricks on caterpillar treads that didn't quite make it. There were half-tracks carrying office equipment that had been made into a shambles by a single shell hit, their interiors still holding their useless equipage of smashed typewriters, telephones, office files.

There were LCT's turned completely upside down, and lying on their backs, and how they got that way I don't know. There were boats stacked on top of each other, their sides caved in, their suspension doors knocked off.

In this shoreline museum of carnage there were abandoned rolls of barbed wire and smashed bulldozers and big stacks of thrown-away lifebelts and piles of shells still waiting to be moved.

In the water floated empty life rafts and soldiers' packs and ration boxes, and mysterious oranges.

On the beach lay snarled rolls of telephone wire and big rolls of steel matting and stacks of broken, rusting rifles.

On the beach lay, expended, sufficient men and mechanism for a small war. They were gone forever now. And yet we could afford it.

We could afford it because we were on, we had our toehold, and behind us there were such enormous replacements for this wreckage on the beach that you could hardly conceive of their sum total. Men and equipment were flowing from England in such a gigantic stream that it made the waste on the beachhead seem like nothing at all, really nothing at all.

A few hundred yards back on the beach is a high bluff. Up there we had a tent hospital, and a barbed-wire enclosure for prisoners of war. From up there you could see far up and down the beach, in a spectacular crow's-nest view, and far out to sea.

And standing out there on the water beyond all this wreckage was the greatest armada man has ever seen. You simply could not believe the gigantic collection of ships that lay out there waiting to unload.

Looking from the bluff, it lay thick and clear to the far horizon of the sea and beyond, and it spread out to the sides and was miles wide. Its utter enormity would move the hardest man.

As I stood up there I noticed a group of freshly taken German prisoners standing nearby. They had not yet been put in the prison cage. They were just standing there, a couple of doughboys leisurely guarding them with tommy guns.

The prisoners too were looking out to sea -- the same bit of sea that for months and years had been so safely empty before their gaze. Now they stood staring almost as if in a trance.

They didn't say a word to each other. They didn't need to. The expression on their faces was something forever unforgettable. In it was the final horrified acceptance of their doom.

If only all Germans could have had the rich experience of standing on the bluff and looking out across the water and seeing what their compatriots saw.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening irony:** "It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore." Then immediately: dead men. This ironic juxtaposition is a Pyle signature.
- **Fragment as emphasis:** "Sure. Hell yes." Three words that carry the bitterness of the entire war.
- **Catalog technique:** Long lists of wreckage ("socks and shoe polish, sewing kits, diaries, Bibles and hand grenades"). The mixing of mundane and lethal items is the point.
- **Anaphora:** "There were... There were... There were..." -- repetition creates a rhythm of overwhelming accumulation.
- **Tonal pivot:** Moves from wreckage to the armada, from waste to might. "Its utter enormity would move the hardest man."
- **Closing power:** Ends not with Americans but with German prisoners looking at the armada. Ironic reversal of perspective.
- **Physical specificity:** "squishy little jellyfish about the size of your hand" -- sensory detail even amid horror.

## Sample 4: "A Long Thin Line of Personal Anguish" (June 17, 1944)

**Theater:** France (Normandy) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** D-Day aftermath

### Full Text

NORMANDY BEACHHEAD, June 17, 1944 -- In the preceding column we told about the D-day wreckage among our machines of war that were expended in taking one of the Normandy beaches.

But there is another and more human litter. It extends in a thin little line, just like a high-water mark, for miles along the beach. This is the strewn personal gear, gear that will never be needed again, of those who fought and died to give us our entrance into Europe.

Here in a jumbled row for mile on mile are soldiers' packs. Here are socks and shoe polish, sewing kits, diaries, Bibles and hand grenades. Here are the latest letters from home, with the address on each one neatly razored out -- one of the security precautions enforced before the boys embarked.

Here are toothbrushes and razors, and snapshots of families back home staring up at you from the sand. Here are pocketbooks, metal mirrors, extra trousers, and bloody, abandoned shoes. Here are broken-handled shovels, and portable radios smashed almost beyond recognition, and mine detectors twisted and ruined.

Here are torn pistol belts and canvas water buckets, first-aid kits and jumbled heaps of lifebelts. I picked up a pocket Bible with a soldier's name in it, and put it in my jacket. I carried it half a mile or so and then put it back down on the beach. I don't know why I picked it up, or why I put it back down.

Soldiers carry strange things ashore with them. In every invasion you'll find at least one soldier hitting the beach at H-hour with a banjo slung over his shoulder. The most ironic piece of equipment marking our beach -- this beach of first despair, then victory -- is a tennis racket that some soldier had brought along. It lies lonesomely on the sand, clamped in its rack, not a string broken.

Two of the most dominant items in the beach refuse are cigarets and writing paper. Each soldier was issued a carton of cigarets just before he started. Today these cartons by the thousand, water-soaked and spilled out, mark the line of our first savage blow.

Writing paper and air-mail envelopes come second. The boys had intended to do a lot of writing in France. Letters that would have filled those blank, abandoned pages.

Always there are dogs in every invasion. There is a dog still on the beach today, still pitifully looking for his masters.

He stays at the water's edge, near a boat that lies twisted and half sunk at the water line. He barks appealingly to every soldier who approaches, trots eagerly along with him for a few feet, and then, sensing himself unwanted in all this haste, runs back to wait in vain for his own people at his own empty boat.

Over and around this long thin line of personal anguish, fresh men today are rushing vast supplies to keep our armies pushing on into France. Other squads of men pick amidst the wreckage to salvage ammunition and equipment that are still usable.

Men worked and slept on the beach for days before the last D-day victim was taken away for burial.

I stepped over the form of one youngster whom I thought dead. But when I looked down I saw he was only sleeping. He was very young, and very tired. He lay on one elbow, his hand suspended in the air about six inches from the ground. And in the palm of his hand he held a large, smooth rock.

I stood and looked at him a long time. He seemed in his sleep to hold that rock lovingly, as though it were his last link with a vanishing world. I have no idea at all why he went to sleep with the rock in his hand, or what kept him from dropping it once he was asleep. It was just one of those little things without explanation that a person remembers for a long time.

The strong, swirling tides of the Normandy coastline shift the contours of the sandy beach as they move in and out. They carry soldiers' bodies out to sea, and later they return them. They cover the corpses of heroes with sand, and then in their whims they uncover them.

As I plowed out over the wet sand of the beach on that first day ashore, I walked around what seemed to be a couple of pieces of driftwood sticking out of the sand. But they weren't driftwood.

They were a soldier's two feet. He was completely covered by the shifting sands except for his feet. The toes of his GI shoes pointed toward the land he had come so far to see, and which he saw so briefly.

### Style Analysis

- **Transition from companion piece:** "In the preceding column..." -- Pyle often wrote multi-part dispatches, each narrowing focus.
- **Anaphora:** "Here are... Here are... Here are..." -- relentless inventory that builds emotional weight.
- **Personal intrusion:** "I picked up a pocket Bible... I don't know why I picked it up, or why I put it back down." This is Pyle inserting confusion and honesty. He doesn't pretend to understand everything.
- **The dog:** An entire paragraph on a lost dog. This is quintessential Pyle -- finding the universal in the specific, the unbearable in the small detail.
- **The sleeping soldier with the rock:** Extended observation that leads to admitted mystery. "I have no idea at all why" -- Pyle embraces not-knowing.
- **Closing image:** "The toes of his GI shoes pointed toward the land he had come so far to see, and which he saw so briefly." One of the most devastating closing lines in war journalism. Simple, concrete, final.
- **Fragment as grief:** "Letters that would have filled those blank, abandoned pages." A sentence fragment that says more by stopping.

## Sample 5: "A Dreadful Masterpiece" (December 30, 1940)

**Theater:** London (pre-US entry) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** London Blitz

### Full Text

LONDON, December 30, 1940 -- Someday when peace has returned to this odd world I want to come to London again and stand on a certain balcony on a moonlit night and look down upon the peaceful silver curve of the Thames with its dark bridges.

And standing there, I want to tell somebody who has never seen it how London looked on a certain night in the holiday season of the year 1940.

For on that night this old, old city -- even though I must bite my tongue in shame for saying it -- was the most beautiful sight I have ever seen.

It was a night when London was ringed and stabbed with fire.

They came just after dark, and somehow I could sense from the quick, bitter firing of the guns that there was to be no monkey business this night.

Shortly after the sirens wailed I could hear the Germans grinding overhead. In my room, with its black curtains drawn across the windows, you could feel the shake from the guns. You could hear the boom, crump, crump, crump, of heavy bombs at their work of tearing buildings apart. They were not too far away.

Half an hour after the firing started I gathered a couple of friends and went to a high, darkened balcony that gave us a view of one-third of the entire circle of London.

As we stepped out onto the balcony a vast inner excitement came over all of us -- an excitement that had neither fear nor horror in it, because it was too full of awe.

You have all seen big fires, but I doubt if you have ever seen the whole horizon of a city lined with great fires -- scores of them, perhaps hundreds.

The closest fires were near enough for us to hear the crackling flames and the yells of firemen. Little fires grew into big ones even as we watched. Big ones died down under the firemen's valor only to break out again later.

About every two minutes a new wave of planes would be over. The motors seemed to grind rather than roar, and to have an angry pulsation like a bee buzzing in blind fury.

The bombs did not make a constant overwhelming din as in those terrible days of last September. They were intermittent -- sometimes a few seconds apart, sometimes a minute or more.

Their sound was sharp, when nearby, and soft and muffled, far away.

Into the dark, shadowed spaces below us, as we watched, whole batches of incendiary bombs fell. We saw two dozen go off in two seconds. They flashed terrifically, then quickly simmered down to pinpoints of dazzling white, burning ferociously.

These white pinpoints would go out one by one as the unseen heroes of the moment smothered them with sand. But also, as we watched, other pinpoints would burn on and pretty soon a yellow flame would leap up from the white center. They had done their work -- another building was on fire.

The greatest of all the fires was directly in front of us. Flames seemed to whip hundreds of feet into the air. Pinkish-white smoke ballooned upward in a great cloud, and out of this cloud there gradually took shape -- so faintly at first that we weren't sure we saw correctly -- the gigantic dome and spires of St. Paul's Cathedral.

St. Paul's was surrounded by fire, but it came through. It stood there in its enormous proportions -- growing slowly clearer and clearer, the way objects take shape at dawn. It was like a picture of some miraculous figure that appears before peace-hungry soldiers on a battlefield. The streets below us were semi-illuminated from the glow.

Immediately above the fires the sky was red and angry, and overhead, making a ceiling in the vast heavens, there was a cloud of smoke all in pink. Up in that pink shrouding there were tiny, brilliant specks of flashing light -- anti-aircraft shells bursting. After the flash you could hear the sound.

Up there, too, the barrage balloons were standing out as clearly as if it were daytime, but now they were pink instead of silver. And now and then through a hole in that pink shroud there twinkled incongruously a permanent, genuine star -- the old-fashioned kind that has always been there.

Below us the Thames grew lighter, and all around below were the shadows -- the dark shadows of buildings and bridges that formed the base of this dreadful masterpiece.

Later on I borrowed a tin hat and went out among the fires. That was exciting too, but the thing I shall always remember above all the other things in my life is the monstrous loveliness of that one single view of London on a holiday night -- London stabbed with great fires, shaken by explosions, its dark regions along the Thames sparkling with the pinpoints of white-hot bombs, all of it roofed over with a ceiling of pink that held bursting shells, balloons, flares and the grind of vicious engines. And in yourself the excitement and anticipation and wonder in your soul that this could be happening at all.

These things all went together to make the most hateful, most beautiful single scene I have ever known.

### Style Analysis

- **Frame technique:** Opens in the future, looking back. "Someday when peace has returned..." This creates nostalgia for a moment not yet past.
- **Confession:** "even though I must bite my tongue in shame for saying it" -- honest admission that destruction can be beautiful. This moral complexity is central to Pyle.
- **Onomatopoeia:** "boom, crump, crump, crump" -- the sounds of war rendered in words.
- **Color palette:** Pink, red, white, silver, dark. Pyle paints this like an artist, not a reporter.
- **The star:** "through a hole in that pink shroud there twinkled incongruously a permanent, genuine star -- the old-fashioned kind that has always been there." This detail grounds the apocalypse in the eternal.
- **Oxymoron closing:** "most hateful, most beautiful" -- the piece resolves on irreconcilable tension. Pyle does not pretend war makes sense.
- **Pre-war Pyle:** This is travel-column Pyle meeting war-correspondent Pyle. More lyrical, more painterly than his later infantry dispatches.

## Sample 6: "On Victory in Europe" (April 1945 -- Last Column)

**Theater:** Pacific (Okinawa) | **Source:** Found in Pyle's pocket after his death on Ie Shima | **Period:** Final dispatch

### Full Text

And so it is over. The catastrophe on one side of the world has run its course. The day that it had so long seemed would never come has come at last. I suppose our emotions here in the Pacific are the same as they were among Allies all over the world. First a shouting of the good news with such joyous surprise that you would think the shouter himself had brought it about.

And then an unspoken sense of gigantic relief -- and then a hope that the collapse in Europe would hasten the end in the Pacific.

It has been seven months since I heard my last shot in the European War. Now I am as far away from it as it is possible to get on this globe.

This is written on a little ship lying off the coast of the Island of Okinawa, just south of Japan, on the other side of the world from Ardennes.

But my heart is still in Europe, and that's why I am writing this column.

It is to the boys who were my friends for so long. My one regret of the war is that I was not with them when it ended.

For the companionship of two and a half years of death and misery is a spouse that tolerates no divorce. Such companionship finally becomes a part of one's soul, and it cannot be obliterated.

True, I am with American boys in the other war not yet ended, but I am old-fashioned and my sentiment runs to old things.

To me the European War is old, and the Pacific War is new.

Last summer I wrote that I hoped the end of the war could be a gigantic relief, but not an elation. In the joyousness of high spirits it is so easy for us to forget the dead. Those who are gone would not wish themselves to be a millstone of gloom around our necks.

But there are so many of the living who have had burned into their brains forever the unnatural sight of cold dead men scattered over the hillsides and in the ditches along the high rows of hedge throughout the world.

Dead men by mass production -- in one country after another -- month after month and year after year. Dead men in winter and dead men in summer.

Dead men in such familiar promiscuity that they become monotonous.

Dead men in such monstrous infinity that you come almost to hate them.

Those are the things that you at home need not even try to understand. To you at home they are columns of figures, or he is a near one who went away and just didn't come back. You didn't see him lying so grotesque and pasty beside the gravel road in France.

We saw him, saw him by the multiple thousands. That's the difference.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening simplicity:** "And so it is over." Five words. The weight is in the understatement.
- **Geographic grounding:** Pyle always tells you exactly where he is. "a little ship lying off the coast of the Island of Okinawa."
- **Marriage metaphor:** "the companionship of two and a half years of death and misery is a spouse that tolerates no divorce." Unusually literary for Pyle.
- **Anaphora of death:** "Dead men by mass production... Dead men in winter... Dead men in such familiar promiscuity... Dead men in such monstrous infinity..." The repetition creates numbing, which IS the point.
- **The confrontation:** "You didn't see him lying so grotesque and pasty beside the gravel road in France." Direct accusation of the home front's ignorance.
- **Final line:** "We saw him, saw him by the multiple thousands. That's the difference." The repetition of "saw him" carries all the exhaustion.
- **Unfinished:** Found in his pocket. The column is complete enough to publish, but there's a raw quality -- as if Pyle's editor (death) stopped him mid-thought.

## Sample 7: Anzio Dispatches (February-April 1944)

**Theater:** Italy (Anzio Beachhead) | **Source:** Scripps Howard syndicated column | **Period:** Anzio Campaign

### Key Passages

"When you get to Anzio, you waste no time getting off the boat, for you have been feeling pretty much like a clay pigeon in a shooting gallery."

"After a few hours in Anzio, you wish you were back on the boat, for you could hardly describe being ashore as any haven of peacefulness."

"This is a new kind of warfare for us. Here, distances are short, and space is confined. The whole beachhead is the front line."

"Men have dug underground and built themselves homes."

"It's a look of dullness -- eyes that look without seeing, eyes that see without transferring any response to the mind."

"When our bombing was over, my room was in shambles. It was the sort of thing you see only in the movies."

"There has been some exhilaration here and some fun, along with the misery and the sadness."

"It must be an awful thing to go up to the brink of possible death in the nighttime in a faraway land, puzzled and afraid, knowing no one."

### Style Analysis

- **Immediate address:** "When you get to Anzio" -- second person pulls reader in instantly.
- **Ironic understatement:** "you could hardly describe being ashore as any haven of peacefulness" -- classic Pyle litotes.
- **Clinical description of trauma:** "eyes that look without seeing, eyes that see without transferring any response to the mind" -- describing what we now call PTSD.
- **The small and the large:** Juxtaposes movie references with death, exhilaration with sadness.
- **Closing empathy:** "puzzled and afraid, knowing no one" -- these adjectives humanize the soldier completely.

## Sample 8: Letters from the Front (1944)

**Source:** Personal correspondence, published posthumously | **Period:** Late winter/early spring 1944

### Key Passages

"I've got so I brood about it, about the whole thing, I mean, and I have a personal reluctance to die that is always in my mind, like a weight. Instead of growing stronger and hard as good veterans do, I've become weaker and more frightened. I'm allright when I'm actually at the front, but it's when I pull back and start thinking and visualizing that it almost overwhelms me."

"I've been pretty low for a month and a half. Have felt so damn lousy, and no word from Jerry."

"If I can just see the European war out, I think I might feel justified in quitting the war."

"There's such a thing as pressing your luck too far in one spot."

### Style Analysis

- **Vulnerability:** In private letters, Pyle drops all pretense. "I've become weaker and more frightened" is the opposite of his public courage.
- **Colloquial honesty:** "so damn lousy" -- the same plain language of his columns, but turned inward.
- **Self-awareness:** He recognizes his own mental deterioration. The distinction between "actually at the front" (manageable) and "thinking and visualizing" (overwhelming) is precise trauma description.
- **Fatalism:** "pressing your luck too far" -- Pyle died five months later.

## Common Patterns Across All Samples

### Sentence Structure
- **Average length:** Medium. Neither consistently short nor long. The variation IS the rhythm.
- **Fragments used sparingly but powerfully:** "Sure. Hell yes." / "Dead men in summer."
- **Compound sentences joined by "and":** His most powerful sentences chain clauses with "and" rather than subordinating them. "And then he got up and walked away down the road in the moonlight, all alone."
- **Short declaratives for emphasis:** "That's all he said." / "That's the difference." / "They were not driftwood."

### Paragraph Organization
- **One-sentence paragraphs for impact:** "It was a night when London was ringed and stabbed with fire."
- **Catalog paragraphs:** Long lists of observed items, each anchored by "Here are" or "There were."
- **Transition paragraphs:** Short bridges between scenes. "Then a soldier came into the cowshed and said there were some more bodies outside."

### Transition Styles
- **Temporal:** "Then... And then... After that..." -- simple chronological progression.
- **No formal transitions:** Pyle often just jumps. New paragraph, new scene. No "Meanwhile" or "In contrast."
- **Pivot sentences:** "Now to the infantry" -- a single sentence shifts the entire piece's focus.

### Voice Quirks and Repeated Phrases
- **"I don't know"** -- admitted frequently. Pyle embraces ignorance.
- **"You"** -- constant second-person address pulling reader into the scene.
- **"the boys"** -- his consistent term for soldiers. Never "troops" in emotional passages, rarely "men."
- **"sort of"** and "kind of"** -- deliberate imprecision that sounds like speech.
- **"I think"** and "I suppose"** -- hedging that creates intimacy and honesty.
- **Colloquial insertions:** "Sure. Hell yes." / "God damn it."

### Opening Patterns
- **Dateline + immediate scene:** "We're now with an infantry outfit..."
- **Simple declarative:** "And so it is over."
- **Ironic setup:** "It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore."
- **Future-looking frame:** "Someday when peace has returned..."

### Closing Patterns
- **Image that crystallizes meaning:** Soldier's feet pointing toward France. Man walking alone in moonlight.
- **Deliberate anticlimax:** "We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep."
- **Direct address to reader:** "if you could see them just once..."
- **Single devastating sentence:** "That's the difference."

### Punctuation Patterns
- **Em-dashes:** Used moderately for parenthetical asides. "even though I must bite my tongue in shame for saying it --"
- **Ellipses:** Almost never. Pyle does not trail off. He stops.
- **Periods:** His primary tool. Short sentences. Declarative stops.
- **Commas in compound sentences:** Heavy use of "and" + comma: "and he sat there for a full five minutes, holding the dead hand"

### Tone and Emotional Register
- **Understated grief:** The most powerful moments are the quietest.
- **Never sentimental:** Pyle avoids exclamation points, avoids telling you what to feel.
- **Moral complexity:** Admits beauty in destruction, hatred of the dead, shame at survival.
- **Everyman voice:** Writes as though talking to a neighbor. No jargon, no literary pretension.
- **Anger beneath calm:** The fury surfaces in fragments. "Sure. Hell yes." "God damn it to hell anyway."

### Distinctive Markers That Make Pyle Recognizable
1. **Second-person "you" pulling reader into foxhole**
2. **Concrete physical detail of the small and mundane** (sewing kits, toothbrushes, shoe polish)
3. **Soldiers as named or described individuals**, not abstract "forces"
4. **Admitted ignorance and confusion** ("I don't know why I picked it up")
5. **One-sentence paragraphs for maximum impact**
6. **Compound "and" chains** building to emotional peaks
7. **Closing images that stop the breath**
8. **Colloquial language** -- writes the way humans talk
9. **The pivot from tactical to emotional** in a single transition
10. **Anticlimax as devastation** -- going back to sleep after witnessing death

A small voice came in the night and said, "Go."

And when I put it up to the boss he leaned back in his chair and said, "Go."

And when I sat alone with my so-called conscience and asked it what to do, it pointed and said, "Go."

So I'm on my way to London.

Never before have I set out on a long trip with anything but elation in my heart. It is not so with this trip. This one is no lark. It will be tough and I know it.

I will be scared. I know I will feel small and in the way among a people who are doing a job of life and death.

The sailing of a ship, the world over, is a gay event. A ship carries people out of reality, into illusion. People who go away on ships are going away to better things. But that was not true as we sailed for Europe. There was no gayety on the Exeter. Never, on any ocean or in any climate, have I seen a ship sail so drearily. I doubt there is a single person on board who goes joyously. Certainly no one is going for the fun of it. The Exeter takes its human cargo into the land of heavy reality, rather than from it.

There were no farewell parties aboard ship. What few people had visitors to see them off sat in the lounges in small, quiet groups, talking seriously.

That Girl came to the ship with me. And so did an old friend we hadn't seen for years—Jim Moran, the fellow who hunted the needle in the public haystack, and who sold an icebox to an Eskimo. Maybe you've read about him. We knew Moran back when he was just an amateur crazy-man. He was a gay fellow to have around this day, and we were grateful for him. He tried his best to add a touch of joviality to the long-faced atmosphere of departure.

They left the ship at noon—Moran and That Girl. We couldn't sit there any longer, just waiting for the last moment to come. I walked out into the pier shed with them. She slipped me a note she had written, and I put it in my pocket. We have known each other a long time.

We didn't try to say anything but just good-bye. And we made it quick. For a minute I watched them walking away, down the long pier shed. Then I went to my cabin and shut the door.

Finally, at two o'clock, we sailed. Everybody had gone. The dock was empty and dead. There was no shouting, no confetti, not even a handkerchief waved. The lonely dock simply drew away. Nothing more, as we sailed on a cold gray afternoon in November toward the darkness of Europe.

---

**Patterns Observed**:
- **Opening incantation**: Three-beat "Go" repetition creates Biblical/prophetic tone unusual for journalism
- **"That Girl" reference**: Jerry Pyle, his wife, never named directly—creates intimacy while maintaining privacy
- **Anticlimax as method**: "The lonely dock simply drew away. Nothing more" - refuses dramatic flourish
- **Admission of fear**: "I will be scared" - vulnerability as authenticity, written BEFORE experiencing danger
- **Fragment power**: "Nothing more" - ends on deliberate flatness that amplifies dread

## Sample 10: "Peace to War—Seven Hours" (December 1940 - Arrival in England)

The phone rang in our hotel room in Lisbon, and we were told to be at the marine airport before daylight this morning. Don't think I didn't get all a-twitter. Our almost two solid weeks of waiting were drawing to an end, and Lait and I decided not even to go to bed.

Each of us left a small suitcase in Lisbon, to cut down the weight. I put my excess necessities in a white sugar sack which a boat steward had given me. And so today I arrived in England carrying a small yellow bag, a typewriter, and a knotted-up sugar sack over my shoulder.

It was cold and eerie in the dimly lighted airport building at Lisbon. We walked up and down to keep warm, until finally the captain said, "Let's go." We followed the crew along a pier, and got into a motorboat. We could make out dimly the shapes of two big flying boats at anchor. As our boat eased up to one of them, we jumped through the door.

The plane had four motors, and was bigger than the Baby Clippers of Pan American Airways, but not as big as the regular Clippers. She was camouflaged.

The cabin was partitioned into three compartments, with smoking permitted in the rear one. I had supposed that these planes were stripped of all peacetime travel comforts to save weight, but not so. The seats were deep and comfortable, the floor was carpeted.

It might have been a flight in peacetime. Every one on the plane immediately went to sleep. I slept for a while, but curiosity got the better of me, and from daylight on I stayed awake.

Dawn found us over the ocean, with no land in sight. I had been told the flight would take ten hours, but we picked up a howling tailwind and came through in less than seven hours. Time didn't drag at all. Five hours out, I went through the plane and every passenger was asleep. As far as I could observe, not one person ever spoke to another during the trip. There were seven Americans aboard, one Swiss, and three Englishmen.

The steward served coffee and sandwiches, and later fruit. Then he came around and blacked out the windows so the passengers couldn't see out. This was done by putting a section of frosted glass over the regular windows, with rubber suction cups. This lets in light but prevents you from seeing out. I presume it is done to keep passengers from seeing convoys in the water below. But the joke was that the steward blacked out every window except mine. Either he ran out of frosted panes or else he thought I was blind. At any rate I stared out the window the whole trip.

Land came into view on the left. It was dark brown and bare, a high, rugged coast. I thought it was Ireland. We flew along this coast for an hour. The air got rough, and five passengers were very sick. Somehow I escaped that. We passed only two ships, both small. One of them flashed a signal to us with a blinker. We did not see a single plane on the trip.

Suddenly the pilot throttled down his motors and we started losing altitude. Then I realized we had not been flying along Ireland, but along the coast of England itself. We landed far out from shore among a lot of boats at anchor and camouflaged planes resting on the water. As we struck the surface there was that familiar long ripping sound.

I felt like a character in a dream. The journey from America was over. We had arrived. But it didn't seem really true. Any moment I expected to wake up and find myself still between those perpetual walls of the Hotel Europa in Lisbon.

It was raining. We walked a hundred yards along the docks, then into the main street of the little town. There were soldiers on the street, carrying tin hats and gas masks. There were women in khaki uniforms, and many people on bicycles. All the store windows were criss-crossed with strips of paper. This tends to prevent shattering from the concussion when bombs explode in the neighborhood. Strips of many colors, pasted in many designs, made the town look as though it had been decorated for Christmas instead of patched up for the war.

I wish you could see that village street. It was like a picture from a Dickens novel. The gabled buildings, the language of the signs, the many smoking chimney pots were all the England of fiction, so peaceful, neat and secure. I had not been ashore three minutes before I was in love with England.

We were escorted to a big ground-floor room, the temporary office of the British Overseas Airways. There were easy chairs and couches and a coal fire in the grate, and a boy was serving hot tea. It took us two hours to get through all the inspections. We were taken one at a time into a room where two men questioned us. They asked about our purpose in coming, about our money, about whom we knew, and so on. It was by no means a grilling. They did it in a way that made you feel you were just sitting there chatting. The procedure was more than courteous; it seemed genuinely friendly.

After that they went through our baggage minutely. They even read our letters. But so great is English courtesy that the customs man asked me to take each letter from its envelope for him. He evidently thought it would be prying for him to do so! And then as train time drew near he said we would have to hurry to catch it, so he closed the bags without finishing the inspection, gave us advice about trains and the blackout in London, and hustled us into a waiting car provided by the air line.

**Patterns Observed**:
- **Physical comedy**: Sugar sack over shoulder - self-deprecation as charm, undercutting war correspondent mystique
- **"Don't think I didn't"**: Colloquial phrase = conversational intimacy
- **The detail that reveals character**: Customs man too polite to open letters himself - one specific action reveals entire national personality
- **"I wish you could see"**: Direct address pulling reader into scene, creating shared experience
- **Geographic confusion resolved**: "I thought it was Ireland" then "I realized" - admitting error builds trust
- **Instantaneous love**: "I had not been ashore three minutes before I was in love with England" - emotional honesty, no pretense of objectivity

PARIS, August 28, 1944 - I had thought that for me there could never again be any elation in war. But I had reckoned without the liberation of Paris—I had reckoned without remembering that I might be a part of this richly historic day.

The first Allied soldiers to enter Paris were the Second French Armored Division. They had been fighting their way through France for several weeks. They were battle-weary and dirty, and many of them had not slept for days.

Yet when they came to the outskirts of the city, suddenly they seemed to gain a new strength. They plunged into Paris on the evening of August 24, and the city went mad with joy.

For those first few hours of liberation the people were almost animal-like in their panic of joy and relief and gratitude. They were actually crying as they kissed you and screamed, "Thank you, oh thank you, for coming!"

I met Mrs. Helen Cardon, a tall, thin, happy woman in a light brown dress who spoke perfect American. She had lived in Paris for twenty-one years. Her husband was an officer in French Army headquarters and had just returned after two and a half years as a German prisoner.

She said the Germans had not been cruel to Parisians during the occupation, but they had been arrogant and insulting. The German soldiers tried to be nice to people on the streets, but the people would have none of it. The hardest thing to bear, she said, was that there was absolutely nothing you could do about anything.

By the second day the emotional frenzy had worn itself out. Paris was still happily excited, but it had settled down to enjoy its freedom more normally. Restaurants and cafes were open again. People sat at sidewalk tables in the lovely August sunshine, drinking wine and visiting among themselves.

Paris had suffered little damage. There had been considerable fighting in the streets during the insurrection, and you could see marks of bullets all over the place. But I couldn't see that any buildings of consequence had been destroyed. Even the street fighting had resulted in surprisingly little damage.

The city had no gas and very little electricity. The Metro—the subway—was not running. There were no buses. A few ancient taxicabs were running on charcoal burners. The Seine bridges were intact. Water was scarce, but there was enough.

Everywhere you went you saw people carrying flowers. The women had flowers in their hair, men wore them in their buttonholes, and children clutched them in their hands.

Paris was the Paris we had dreamed of. It was a city free once more, a city bursting with gratitude and joy, a city whose happiness was contagious. It was impossible not to be moved by it all.

**Patterns Observed**:
- **Admission of change**: "I had thought that for me there could never again be any elation in war" - acknowledges his own emotional exhaustion, then shows it overcome
- **"Animal-like"**: Doesn't romanticize liberation joy - calls it what it was, primal and overwhelming
- **The specific person**: Mrs. Helen Cardon - name, dress color, background - makes liberation personal not abstract
- **Inventory method**: Lists what's working and what's not (no gas, little electricity, water scarce) - grounds joy in practical reality
- **Flowers everywhere**: Visual motif repeated - symbol allowed to speak for itself without explanation

## Sample 12: "Fed Up and Bogged Down" (Mid-1943 - Sicily)

I've been at the front now more than a year, and I've got to the point where I feel I can't stand it much longer. When you realize you're too tired to be scared anymore, that's the point where something's wrong.

I'm not exactly at that point, but I've been close to it. The last few weeks in Sicily, for instance, I was so tired that the shells bursting around didn't mean much to me anymore. I wasn't scared. I was just numb.

That's a dangerous state to be in. A man who isn't scared in war is either a fool or he's so tired he's lost his normal human reflexes.

I've lost track of why I'm here, or what I'm trying to accomplish. When you get that way, it's time to go home for a while. But the trouble is I don't seem to be able to leave.

I'm writing this sitting in an olive grove on the side of a hill. It's dusk, and I can see down into a Sicilian valley with an ancient town sitting there on a hilltop, all brown and old. There's a thin haze over the valley, and the sun is going down. It's beautiful. I don't know why I'm telling you this except that somehow it seems important to know that there's still beauty in this world, even while we're doing our damnedest to tear it apart.

I suppose the truth is that I'm fed up. Fed up with war, fed up with death and destruction, fed up with living in dirt and discomfort. I want to come home and sit in a restaurant and have a thick steak and coffee with real cream. I want to sleep in a bed with white sheets. I want to have a bath with hot water. I want to see my wife.

But most of all I think I just want to stop. Stop moving. Stop writing. Stop seeing things I don't want to see. Just stop.

I won't, of course. But that's the way I feel.

---

**Patterns Observed**:
- **Too tired to be scared**: Paradox that reveals psychological truth - fear requires energy
- **Landscape interruption**: Olive grove, ancient town, sunset - beauty intrudes on despair, Pyle doesn't resolve the contradiction
- **List of domestic desires**: Steak, cream, white sheets, hot water - mundane specifics carry more weight than grand statements
- **"I won't, of course"**: Four words dismiss everything he just said - duty overrides exhaustion without heroic posturing
- **"Just stop"**: Two-word paragraph - fragment as total emotional truth
- **Self-diagnosis**: "I'm fed up" stated plainly - no euphemism, no apology

IN ITALY, February 21, 1944 - The company commander said to me, "Every man in this company deserves the Silver Star."

We walked around in the olive grove where the men of the company were sitting on the edges of their foxholes, talking or cleaning their gear.

"Let me introduce you to my personal hero," the company commander said. He led me over to a sergeant who was sitting on the ground.

The sergeant was Frank Eversole, of Tell City, Indiana. He shook hands sort of timidly and said, "Pleased to meet you," and then he didn't say any more. I could tell by his eyes and by his slow, courteous speech that he was a Hoosier.

Eversole was a cowboy before the war. He was a modest, sincere man, and so quiet he seemed almost timid. Yet he had killed more Germans in his company than any other man—as far as the company commander knew. He had been decorated with the Silver Star and two Bronze Stars.

When the company commander had gone, I sat down on the ground with Eversole and we talked. Or rather I talked and he answered in monosyllables. It was hard to get anything out of him. Eventually I learned that he had been overseas sixteen months. He had been in the lines all that time, except for two short furloughs. He had been through Tunisia, Sicily, and the entire Italian campaign.

He was a technical sergeant, and he led a squad. He had been wounded once, but not badly. He had had countless narrow escapes. Every veteran infantryman I've ever talked to had escaped death so many times that it seemed miraculous.

Most of them had stopped worrying about it. They figured they either would or wouldn't get through, and that was that. It was Eversole's turn to worry now.

"How much longer do you think you'll last?" I asked him.

"I don't know," he said, looking away. "I figure I'm about due. I've been very lucky. I'm scared all the time now. I never used to be. I don't want to be yellow, but I'm getting so I want to hide all the time."

He was only twenty-eight years old, but already he was an old man in war. His spirit was going. He talked about it without shame or bravado, just stating it as a fact.

"I've been having awful dreams," he said. "I dream about killing Germans. I wake up and there's a German standing over me. It's getting so I hate to go to sleep. But I'm more scared in the daytime."

"Are you going to keep on till you crack up?" I asked.

"I guess so," he said. "I can't see any way out. I've been lucky in always having my squad come through without many casualties, and I'm superstitious. I'm afraid if I leave they'll all get it. And they're depending on me. They've been depending on me for a year. I can't let them down."

I sat there on the ground and looked at the man. His eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep. His beard was straggly. His face was thin. His expression was that of a man who had been punched and beaten for so long that he no longer cared what happened. And yet underneath all that you could sense his dogged determination to keep going.

Sergeant Frank Eversole was just one man in a war of millions. But that day in that olive grove in Italy he seemed to me to represent all the millions. He was the guy that wars can't be won without. He was the common man in all wars from the beginning of time.

Three days later Sergeant Frank Eversole was killed. He was leading his squad in a night attack when a German machine gun cut him down.

---

**Patterns Observed**:
- **"Pleased to meet you"**: Quotes Eversole's plain speech - lets character speak himself
- **The question asked directly**: "How much longer do you think you'll last?" - no euphemism, asks what others avoid
- **"I guess so"**: Eversole's resignation in two words - more powerful than paragraph of description
- **Dreams detail**: Nightmares specified - PTSD symptoms reported without modern terminology
- **The closing blow**: "Three days later" - Pyle's restraint makes it devastating. No sentiment, just fact.
- **"I can't let them down"**: Duty stated simply - Eversole's entire philosophy in five words
- **Looking at the man**: "I sat there on the ground and looked at the man" - Pyle positions himself as witness, gives Eversole full attention

## Sample 14: "The Flying Wedge" - B-26 Marauder Squadron (April 1944)

I met two bombardiers in a London pub—Lieutenants Lindsey Greene and Jack Arnold. Arnold everybody called "Red Dog" because of his red hair.

They invited me up to visit their station, and I took them up on it. Their field was at a place called Earls Colne, a little farming village about fifty miles northeast of London.

The 391st Bomb Group flew the B-26 Marauder, the medium bomber known as the "Flying Prostitute" because it had no visible means of support. The wings looked too small for the fuselage. Old-timers said the early models were tricky and dangerous, but by the time I flew in one they had it ironed out pretty well.

I went on a practice bombing run with them. We took off in the cold, misty English dawn, eighteen B-26s in formation. From the bombardier's nose compartment I could look straight down and see the English countryside rolling past underneath—the tiny villages, the miniature farms, the hedgerows, the narrow roads.

The pilot was Lieutenant Chief Collins, from Hartford, Connecticut. The crew said Collins was a fighter pilot at heart who happened to be flying a bomber. He handled the big Marauder as though it were a P-38. His crew had fanatical faith in him.

Red Dog Arnold lay on his stomach in the nose, his eye to the bombsight. The target was a painted circle on the ground. At the proper moment Red Dog called "Bombs away" and we all felt the ship lighten as the practice bombs dropped.

After we landed I talked to Sergeant Eugene Gaines, the engineer-gunner, a farm boy from near Pontotoc, Mississippi. He had been overseas eight months.

"Do you like combat flying?" I asked.

"I don't mind it," he said. "It's a job that's got to be done. Some days are pretty rough, but you just go ahead and do it."

That was the combat flier's philosophy in a nutshell. No heroics, no dramatics. Just a job to be done.

I noticed that all the enlisted gunners wore two dozen missions painted on their flight jackets—little bomb symbols. I asked Sergeant John Siebert, the radioman from Philadelphia, about them.

"We paint one for every mission," he said. "When you get to twenty-five you're supposed to go home. But they raised it to thirty, and then to thirty-five, and now they don't know what the hell it is. So we just keep painting them on and hope someday they'll let us quit."

Sergeant Kermit Pruitt, the tail gunner from Phoenix, Arizona, had thirty-seven missions. He was a silent, serious boy of about twenty-two. He'd been flying combat for nearly a year.

"What's the worst part?" I asked him.

"The flak," he said without hesitation. "Fighters you can shoot at. Flak just comes up and there's nothing you can do about it but sit there and take it."

That night in the officers' club I sat with Lieutenant Collins and asked him what he thought about when he was flying through heavy flak.

"I don't think," he said. "If you start thinking you're through. You just fly the airplane and hope to God the flak doesn't have your name on it."

Before I left, Red Dog Arnold walked me out to the gate.

"You going to write about us?" he asked.

"I expect so," I said.

"Well, don't make us out to be heroes," he said. "We're just doing a job. There's guys in the infantry got it a hundred times worse than we do."

That was three weeks before D-Day. I wonder how many of them made it through.

**Patterns Observed**:
- **"Flying Prostitute"**: Includes soldiers' slang nickname - vulgar detail authenticates
- **Name, hometown, specificity**: "Kermit Pruitt... from Phoenix, Arizona" - individuals not interchangeable
- **"I wonder how many"**: Closing doubt - Pyle doesn't pretend to know outcomes, admits uncertainty
- **Letting them deflect**: Red Dog's "don't make us out to be heroes" - Pyle quotes their modesty without arguing
- **Philosophy in nutshell**: "It's a job that's got to be done" - Pyle identifies pattern, names it
- **The thing you can't fight**: "Flak... there's nothing you can do about it but sit there and take it" - powerlessness specified

ABOARD A DESTROYER OFF NORMANDY BEACHHEAD, June 1944 - We had been at sea for days before the invasion. The ship was crammed with soldiers. They slept on deck, in passageways, in every available spot. The sailors gave up their bunks and slept on deck themselves.

The soldiers were quiet and tense. This was it, and they knew it. There was little of the usual soldiers' kidding around. They sat in groups and talked seriously, or wrote letters, or just sat.

The night before we hit the beach, the ship's loudspeaker system played music. Somebody had a stack of records. The music was sentimental—"As Time Goes By" and "I'll Be Seeing You" and stuff like that. It was almost too much. Those boys were going into something and they knew not all of them would be coming back. The music made it worse and better at the same time.

We went in before dawn. The naval bombardment had already started. The battleships and cruisers were firing from far out. The destroyers went in close, only a few hundred yards from shore, and poured it on.

Our ship shook and shuddered with each salvo. The noise was beyond belief. The smell of powder filled the air. Smoke drifted back over the decks.

I stood on the bridge with the ship's officers and watched the shore through binoculars. I could see the flashes of our shells exploding, see buildings disintegrating, see fires starting.

And then I saw something that made me sick. A landing craft, loaded with soldiers, took a direct hit from a shore battery. One moment it was there, the next moment it simply blew apart. I saw bodies flying through the air. I saw the pieces of the boat scattering across the water. And then there was nothing left but debris floating on the surface.

The officer next to me said, "My God." That was all he said.

We kept firing. There was nothing else to do. The beach had to be taken, and this was the price.

All morning we fired. The barrels of the guns got so hot they had to be cooled with water. The ammunition handlers were exhausted, stripped to the waist, pouring sweat. But they kept at it.

By mid-morning the beach was ours. The soldiers went ashore. Some of them would not come back. We knew that. They knew it too.

As I watched them go, I thought about those boys I'd seen on the deck the night before, listening to the sentimental music. I wondered how many of them were already dead.

There is nothing good about war. But if there is anything redeemable, it is the way common men rise to meet impossible demands. That is the only decent thing I have found in this whole bloody mess.

An LST isn't such a glorious ship to look at. It is neither sleek nor fast nor impressively big, and yet it is a good ship and the crews aboard LSTs are proud of them.

The LST is a big steel box with a flat bottom and a door in the front end. It is designed to run right up onto a beach, drop its front door, and unload trucks and tanks and soldiers directly onto the sand.

The LSTs are great rollers—the sailors say they'll even roll in drydock. They have flat bottoms and consequently they roll when there is no sea at all. They roll fast, too. Their usual tempo is a round-trip roll every six seconds.

I lived on an LST for several days. It was not an altogether pleasant experience. I was seasick. Not violently ill, just constantly, miserably on the edge of being sick.

The LST crews were largely young men, kids really. Most of them had never been to sea before the war. They learned as they went along.

The skipper of my LST was a lieutenant from Ohio. He had been a grocery salesman before the war. Now he commanded a ship carrying hundreds of men into battle. It seemed impossible, but there he was doing it.

"Do you like it?" I asked him.

"I like the responsibility," he said. "I like knowing that all these guys depend on me to get them there safely. But I don't like the war part. Hell, who does?"

The LST sailors were a cheerful bunch. They worked hard and they groused good-naturedly about everything. They groused about the food, the Navy, the ship, the war, and each other. It was the normal sailors' way.

But when we finally ran up onto that Normandy beach and dropped the ramp and those soldiers poured off into the water and headed for shore under fire, every man on that LST crew was silent. They just stood there and watched those boys go. They knew what those soldiers were heading into.

After the soldiers had all gone ashore, the skipper said to me, "I'd rather do this job than theirs. At least I can go back to sea. They've got to stay there."

He was quiet for a moment, and then he said, "God help them."

**Patterns Observed**:
- **"Big steel box"**: Anti-romantic description - LST gets no glamour
- **Physical misery admitted**: "I was seasick" - Pyle doesn't pretend to be tough
- **Grocery salesman now ship commander**: Civilian-to-warrior transformation embodied in one man
- **"God help them"**: Skipper's prayer quoted - religious language rare for Pyle, makes it powerful
- **Silence as response**: "every man... was silent" - Pyle reports absence of sound as meaningful
- **Comparative suffering**: Skipper acknowledges infantry has it worse - hierarchy of hell acknowledged

I'm leaving for home. I'm going back to America, and I don't know for how long.

I've been in the war for twenty-nine months. I've covered North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and France. I've lived with the infantry. I've slept in foxholes and on the ground. I've been cold and scared and tired.

I've had all I can take for a while. My spirit is wobbly and my mind is confused. The hurt has finally become too great. All of a sudden it seemed to me that if I heard one more shot or saw one more dead man, I would go off my nut.

I'm not proud of this feeling. I'm not proud of leaving while the war is still going on. But I've got to do it. If I don't, I'll crack up completely.

I know millions of men can't come home. I know they have to keep going until it's over or until they're dead. I know I'm a privileged person to be able to leave. I know all this, and it makes me feel guilty. But I'm going anyway.

I've seen too much death. I've seen too many young men cut down. I've seen too much pain and suffering. It's burned into my brain, and I can't forget it.

At night I dream about it. I dream about the dead men I've seen. I dream about the ones who screamed when they were hit. I dream about the ones who died quietly, without a sound.

I'm tired of living in dirt. I'm tired of being scared. I'm tired of the constant noise of war—the shells and the bombs and the machine guns. I want quiet. I want peace.

More than anything, I want to stop seeing young men die.

I don't know how long I'll stay home. Maybe a month, maybe longer. I need to rest. I need to sleep in a real bed. I need to eat real food. I need to see my wife and know that there are still normal things in the world.

And then maybe I'll be able to go back. Maybe I'll be strong enough to take some more. But right now I'm not. Right now I've had all I can take.

This war will go on without me for a while. The soldiers I've written about will keep fighting. Some of them will die. And I won't be there to tell their stories.

That's what makes me feel the worst.

NORMANDY BEACHHEAD, June 16, 1944 - I took a walk along the historic coast of Normandy in the country of France.

It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore. Men were sleeping on the sand, some of them sleeping forever. Men were floating in the water, but they didn't know they were in the water, for they were dead.

The water was full of squishy little jellyfish about the size of your hand. Millions of them. In the center each of them had a green design exactly like a four-leaf clover. The good-luck emblem. Sure. Hell yes.

I walked for a mile and a half along the water's edge of our many-miled invasion beach. You wanted to walk slowly, for the detail on that beach was infinite.

The wreckage was vast and startling. The awful waste and destruction of war, even aside from the loss of human life, has always been one of its outstanding features to those who are in it. Anything and everything is expendable. And we did expend on our beachhead in Normandy during those first few hours.

For a mile out from the beach there were scores of tanks and trucks and boats that you could no longer see, for they were at the bottom of the water—swamped by overloading, or hit by shells, or sunk by mines. Most of their crews were lost.

You could see trucks tipped half over and swamped. You could see partly sunken barges, and the angled-up corners of jeeps, and small landing craft half submerged. And at low tide you could still see those vicious six-pronged iron snares that helped snag and wreck them.

On the beach itself, high and dry, were all kinds of wrecked vehicles. There were tanks that had only just made the beach before being knocked out. There were jeeps that had been burned to a dull gray. There were big derricks on caterpillar treads that didn't quite make it. There were half-tracks carrying office equipment that had been made into a shambles by a single shell hit, their interiors still holding their useless equipage of smashed typewriters, telephones, office files.

There were LCTs turned completely upside down, and lying on their backs, and how they got that way I don't know. There were boats stacked on top of each other, their sides caved in, their suspension doors knocked off.

In this shoreline museum of carnage there were abandoned rolls of barbed wire and smashed bulldozers and big stacks of thrown-away lifebelts and piles of shells still waiting to be moved.

In the water floated empty life rafts and soldiers' packs and ration boxes, and mysterious oranges.

On the beach lay snarled rolls of telephone wire and big rolls of steel matting and stacks of broken, rusting rifles.

On the beach lay, expended, sufficient men and mechanism for a small war. They were gone forever now. And yet we could afford it.

We could afford it because we were on, we had our toehold, and behind us there were such enormous replacements for this wreckage on the beach that you could hardly conceive of their sum total. Men and equipment were flowing from England in such a gigantic stream that it made the waste on the beachhead seem like nothing at all, really nothing at all.

A few hundred yards back on the beach is a high bluff. Up there we had a tent hospital, and a barbed-wire enclosure for prisoners of war. From up there you could see far up and down the beach, in a spectacular crow's-nest view, and far out to sea.

And standing out there on the water beyond all this wreckage was the greatest armada man has ever seen. You simply could not believe the gigantic collection of ships that lay out there waiting to unload.

Looking from the bluff, it lay thick and clear to the far horizon of the sea and beyond, and it spread out to the sides and was miles wide. Its utter enormity would move the hardest man.

As I stood up there I noticed a group of freshly taken German prisoners standing nearby. They had not yet been put in the prison cage. They were just standing there, a couple of doughboys leisurely guarding them with tommy guns.

The prisoners too were looking out to sea—the same bit of sea that for months and years had been so safely empty before their gaze. Now they stood staring almost as if in a trance.

They didn't say a word to each other. They didn't need to. The expression on their faces was something forever unforgettable. In it was the final horrified acceptance of their doom.

If only all Germans could have had the rich experience of standing on the bluff and looking out across the water and seeing what their compatriots saw.

**Patterns Observed**:
- **Four-leaf clover jellyfish**: Absurd detail - "good luck emblem" in water full of dead men, bitter irony
- **"Sure. Hell yes."**: Three-word paragraph, sarcasm as grief
- **Catalog technique extended**: Longer list than Sample 3 - accumulation creates overwhelming effect
- **"mysterious oranges"**: Unexplained detail - Pyle doesn't pretend to understand everything
- **Scale reversal**: "sufficient men and mechanism for a small war" = expendable - reframes catastrophe as acceptable loss
- **German prisoners' faces**: "final horrified acceptance of their doom" - Pyle reads enemy faces, closes on their perspective
- **Wish for German witness**: "If only all Germans" - rare moment of strategic thinking, wanting them to see their own defeat
