# Ernie Pyle - Writing Patterns

## Status
**Extraction Status**: Partial (from 8 samples)
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-09
**Next Step**: Expand corpus to 25+ samples, complete pattern extraction

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Structural Patterns

**"The Worm's Eye View"**
- Write from soldier/individual perspective, never command level
- Position self as peer/advocate, not authority
- Ground narrative in physical location and immediate experience

**Anticlimax Endings**
- Avoid dramatic conclusions or moral summaries
- End with mundane physical detail or simple action
- Example: "We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep."

**Irregular Rhythm**
- Vary sentence length dramatically
- Mix fragments with compound sentences
- Break up perfect parallel structure

### 2. Voice Markers

**Second-Person Address**
- Frequent "you" to pull reader into scene
- Creates conversational intimacy
- Example: "You can feel the room tense up"

**Compound "And" Chains**
- Multiple clauses connected with "and"
- Creates breathless, witnessing-in-real-time effect
- Example: "They shuffle out and most looking like they could sleep standing up and Rickover looks the same"

**Admitted Ignorance**
- Openly state what he doesn't know or understand
- Shows vulnerability, builds trust
- Example: "I don't know what they're building. I don't know why..."

### 3. Content Patterns

**Physical Observations**
- Concrete sensory details (red eyes, coffee cups, rubbing face)
- Specific objects and actions
- Avoid abstract concepts

**Human Conflict**
- Arguments that don't resolve
- People being wrong
- Frustration and mistakes
- Real consequences

**One-Sentence Paragraphs**
- Used for impact or transition
- Creates white space and breathing room
- Varies rhythm

### 4. What Pyle NEVER Does

❌ Perfect parallel structure
❌ Clean categorical lists
❌ "Here's where it gets interesting" (AI phrase)
❌ Meta-commentary about the writing itself
❌ Forced scene-setting for "humanization"
❌ Summary statements at end
❌ Abstract concepts without grounding

### 5. Testing Results

**Best Performance**: 61% Human (Conflict Version)
- Multiple unresolved arguments
- Real mistakes with consequences
- People contradicting each other
- No clean ending

**Worst Performance**: 100% AI (Tech-Honest Version)
- Explicit AI terminology
- Technical explanations
- Clean narrative structure

**Key Finding**: Topic (AI) matters more than style for AI detection

## Next Steps

1. Expand corpus to 25+ samples
2. Extract sentence-level patterns (average length, punctuation usage)
3. Create rhythm analysis (fragment frequency, compound sentence patterns)
4. Document emotional range patterns (how he handles different tones)
5. Build pattern priority system (which patterns matter most)
