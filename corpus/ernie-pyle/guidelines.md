# Anti-AI Writing Guidelines for LinkedIn Content

**Purpose**: Ensure journalist-generated LinkedIn content passes AI detection tools while maintaining educational value and personality.

**Based on**: Authentic writing samples from Ernie Pyle and Edward R. Murrow (see `ernie-pyle-writing-samples.md` and `edward-murrow-writing-samples.md`)

**Target**: Pass GPTZero, Originality.AI, Turnitin AI detectors with <30% AI probability scores

---

## Core Principle

**The Problem**: Modern AI writing is mechanically perfect. Balanced lists, smooth transitions, pedagogical clarity, zero friction. Human writing has texture—irregularity, fragments, admitted confusion, occasional messiness.

**The Solution**: Add intentional human markers without losing clarity or educational value. Make it messy in the right ways.

**The Paradox**: Pyle and Murrow wrote "deceptively simple prose" that was "meticulous but felt conversational." That's human. AI writes "perfectly structured educational content." That's detectable.

## Part 1: Structural Anti-Patterns (What to AVOID)

### ANTI-PATTERN 1: Perfect Parallel Structure

❌ **AI-style (mechanical repetition):**
```
For the beginners: I'll show you how AI development works
For the practitioners: I'll reveal technical patterns
For the decision-makers: I'll document the real costs
```

✅ **Human-style (irregular formats):**
```
Beginners—you'll see how this actually works. No CS degree required.

Practitioners get the technical stuff buried in the stories. Multi-agent coordination patterns, content management strategies, the things that matter when you're building at scale.

Decision-makers? I'll track real costs. Time, complexity, infrastructure. Not the sales pitch.
```

**Why it works**: Different structures per audience. No "I'll show you" repetition. More direct.

---

### ANTI-PATTERN 2: Mechanical Lists (Always 3 Items, Always Same Length)

❌ **AI-style:**
```
- First point with explanation
- Second point with explanation
- Third point with explanation
```

✅ **Human-style:**
```
- Short point
- Another short one
- This one's longer because it needs context and actual explanation that serves the reader
- Wait, four items? Sure.
```

**Why it works**: Irregular count. Variable length. Breaks expectation of "balanced" presentation.

---

### ANTI-PATTERN 3: Every Paragraph = Topic Sentence + Support + Conclusion

❌ **AI-style (textbook structure):**
```
Montgomery isn't doing this sequentially [TOPIC]. He's attacking all 14 fronts simultaneously [ELABORATION]. Each commander gets their own site variant and complete autonomy over execution [SUPPORT]. You can see where this is going [CONCLUSION].
```

✅ **Human-style (irregular rhythm):**
```
Montgomery isn't doing this sequentially. All 14 fronts at once.

Each commander gets a site variant. Complete autonomy. Patton takes "brutal"—aggressive, no-nonsense. Nimitz gets "glass"—elegant transparency. Rickover handles "terminal" because if anyone understands technical precision, it's the man who ran the nuclear Navy with zero-defect culture for 63 years.

Personalities matter.
```

**Why it works**: Fragment sentences. No perfect topic-sentence structure. Some paragraphs are just statements. Irregular rhythm.

---

### ANTI-PATTERN 4: Meta-Commentary About the Writing

❌ **AI-style:**
```
"I'll be filing dispatches from each front over the next 6-9 weeks."
"In this series, you'll learn..."
"This is what to expect from this campaign..."
```

✅ **Human-style:**
```
"Montgomery briefed 24 commanders this morning."
[Just tell the story. Don't announce you're telling it.]
```

**Why it works**: Humans don't narrate their narration. They just narrate.

**Pyle example**: He never wrote "I'll be documenting the infantry for you." He just documented them.

---

### ANTI-PATTERN 5: Perfect Explicit Transitions

❌ **AI-style:**
```
"Now let's move to the technical implementation."
"Next, we'll examine the architecture."
"Having covered X, let's turn to Y."
```

✅ **Human-style:**
```
[No transition. Just start next section.]

Or: "The architecture—"
Or: "Technical side:"
Or: [Line break, new paragraph, implied continuation]
```

**Why it works**: Abrupt is human. Smooth is AI.

**Pyle example**: "Now to the infantry—the God-damned infantry, as they like to call themselves." Single dash, pivot, done.

---

## Part 2: Language Anti-Patterns (Banned Phrases)

### BANNED PHRASES (Classic AI Tells)

These phrases are AI signatures. Never use them:

❌ "Here's where it gets interesting"
❌ "You might wonder"
❌ "Let me show you"
❌ "Let's dive into"
❌ "It's worth noting that"
❌ "At the end of the day"
❌ "The bottom line is"
❌ "In today's landscape"
❌ "Let's explore"
❌ "Moving forward"
❌ "Needless to say"
❌ "It goes without saying"
❌ "As we've seen"
❌ "As mentioned earlier"

**Why these fail**: Every AI writing tool uses them. They're filler that signals "AI trying to sound conversational."

---

## Part 3: Human Writing Patterns (What TO Do)

### PATTERN 1: Use Sentence Fragments Intentionally

✅ **Examples:**
```
"Montgomery isn't doing this sequentially. All 14 fronts at once."

"Personalities matter."

"You know what happens next."

"Three quality gates. No exceptions."

"Zero tolerance for preventable breaches."
```

**When to use**: Emphasis. Pacing. Dramatic effect. After a complex sentence to punch the point.

**Rule**: Fragments should feel purposeful, not accidental. They're rhetorical choices.

**Pyle example**: "Sure. Hell yes." (Two fragments = complete thought)

---

### PATTERN 2: Vary Rhythm Dramatically

✅ **Example (irregular rhythm):**
```
Short sentence. Another short one. Now here's a longer sentence that builds momentum and adds context and keeps going before finally arriving at its point. Back to short.

This creates texture.
```

❌ **AI-style (mechanical rhythm):**
```
This is a sentence. This is another sentence. This is a third sentence of similar length. The rhythm never changes. Everything feels the same.
```

**Rule**: Mix short-short-long-short, or long-short-short-long. Never settle into predictable patterns.

**Pyle example**: "I was at the foot of the mule trail the night they brought Capt. Waskow's body down. The moon was nearly full at the time, and you could see far up the trail, and even part way across the valley below. Soldiers made shadows in the moonlight as they walked." (Long-long-short rhythm)

---

### PATTERN 3: Start Sentences with "Forbidden" Words

✅ **Examples:**
```
"And that's exactly what happened."
"But here's the thing—"
"Or maybe not."
"Because Montgomery sees it differently."
```

**Why it works**: Grammar teachers say don't start with "And/But/Or/Because." Humans do it anyway. AI avoids it.

**Murrow example**: "And whose fault is that?" (Opening with "And" as rhetorical device)

---

### PATTERN 4: Use Em-Dashes and Interruption

✅ **Examples:**
```
"Patton—he's aggressive—ships fast and fixes in production."

"The challenge is—and this matters—keeping 14 sites synchronized."

"Three pages per site. Maybe four. Depends."
```

**Why it works**: Em-dashes signal spoken thought patterns. AI prefers clean subordinate clauses.

**Murrow example**: "a terrible symphony of light and flame—" (Em-dash as dramatic pause)

---

### PATTERN 5: Implied Context (Don't Over-Explain)

❌ **AI-style (over-explained):**
```
"Admiral Rickover, who was known for his perfectionism and who ran the nuclear Navy for 63 years with a zero-defect culture, takes the terminal variant because his personality matches technical precision."
```

✅ **Human-style (implied):**
```
"Rickover gets terminal. Zero-defect culture for 63 years—if anyone understands technical precision, it's him."
```

**Why it works**: Assumes reader can connect dots. Doesn't laboriously explain everything.

**Pyle example**: "I don't know who that first one was. You feel small in the presence of dead men, and ashamed at being alive, and you don't ask silly questions." (Never explains WHY you don't ask questions—reader understands)

---

### PATTERN 6: Compound "And" Chains (Pyle Signature)

✅ **Examples:**
```
"And then he got up and walked away down the road in the moonlight, all alone."

"We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep."
```

**Why it works**: AI prefers subordinate clauses ("After getting up, he walked away..."). Compound "and" chains feel like natural speech.

**When to use**: Building to emotional climax. Narrative sequences. Creating rhythm.

**Rule**: Use sparingly but powerfully. One per piece maximum.

---

## Part 4: Pyle-Specific Voice Markers

Use these techniques when writing in Pyle's voice (accessible, ground-level storytelling):

### 1. Second-Person "You" Immersion

✅ **Example:**
```
"When you get to Anzio, you waste no time getting off the boat, for you have been feeling pretty much like a clay pigeon in a shooting gallery."
```

**Effect**: Pulls reader into the scene. Makes abstract concepts concrete and personal.

**When to use**: Opening paragraphs. Setting scenes. Making technical concepts accessible.

**AI avoidance**: AI rarely uses sustained second-person because it feels too direct/risky. This is why it works.

---

### 2. Admitted Ignorance

✅ **Example:**
```
"I don't know who that first one was."
"I don't know why I picked it up."
"I suppose..."
```

**Effect**: Creates intimacy and honesty. Shows vulnerability.

**When to use**: When genuinely uncertain. When exploring ideas. To avoid false authority.

**AI avoidance**: AI wants to appear authoritative and avoids "I don't know."

---

### 3. Concrete Mundane Details

✅ **Example:**
```
"sewing kits, toothbrushes, shoe polish"
"their stiffened legs sticking out awkwardly from the other side"
"straightened the points of the captain's shirt collar"
```

**Effect**: Makes abstract concepts tangible. Creates visual anchors.

**When to use**: Describing technical processes. Humanizing AI agents. Grounding abstract concepts.

**Rule**: Small physical details > grand abstractions.

---

### 4. Anticlimax as Devastation

✅ **Example:**
```
"We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and pretty soon we were all asleep."
[After witnessing dead soldiers brought down mountain]
```

**Effect**: The normalcy is the horror. No dramatic conclusion needed.

**When to use**: After intense technical challenges. After major milestones. To show "this is just how we work now."

**AI avoidance**: AI always wants a reflective conclusion. Cutting it off creates human texture.

---

### 5. Colloquial Language & Profanity (Sparingly)

✅ **Example:**
```
"Sure. Hell yes."
"God damn it to hell anyway."
"the God-damned infantry, as they like to call themselves"
```

**Effect**: Authentic voice. Breaks corporate polish.

**When to use**: Rarely. Only when it serves authenticity. Never gratuitous.

**Rule**: One instance per 1000 words maximum. Must feel earned, not forced.

---

### 6. One-Sentence Paragraphs for Impact

✅ **Example:**
```
Personalities matter.

That's the difference.

They were not driftwood.
```

**Effect**: Creates dramatic pause. Emphasizes key point.

**When to use**: After building argument. For pivot moments. For devastating conclusions.

**Rule**: Maximum 2-3 per piece. Overuse kills impact.

---

## Part 5: Murrow-Specific Voice Markers

Use these techniques when writing in Murrow's voice (broadcast gravitas, elevated perspective):

### 1. Geographic/Temporal Grounding (Always First)

✅ **Examples:**
```
"This is London."
"This is Trafalgar Square."
"I'm standing on a rooftop looking out over London."
"It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning."
```

**Effect**: Grounds reader in specific place/time. Creates authority through precision.

**When to use**: ALWAYS. Opening sentence of any Murrow-voiced piece.

**Rule**: Must be first sentence or first phrase. Non-negotiable Murrow signature.

---

### 2. Formal Courtesy Before Difficult Content

✅ **Example:**
```
"Permit me to tell you what you would have seen and heard had you been with me."
[Before describing Buchenwald concentration camp]
```

**Effect**: The courtly formality makes the horror hit harder through contrast.

**When to use**: Before critical analysis. Before challenging reader assumptions. Before difficult truths.

**AI avoidance**: AI uses casual language universally. Formal courtesy feels old-fashioned and therefore human.

---

### 3. "There Are No Words" (Ultimate Technique)

✅ **Examples:**
```
"For most of it, I have no words."
"There are no words to describe the thing that is happening."
"I have observed today that people have very little to say."
```

**Effect**: Declaring language's failure is Murrow's most powerful rhetorical device.

**When to use**: After witnessing something genuinely overwhelming. At end of complex analysis when conclusion defies summary.

**AI avoidance**: AI NEVER admits it lacks words. This is pure human marker.

**Rule**: Once per piece maximum. Only when earned. Never casual.

---

### 4. Rhetorical Parallelism (Sparingly)

✅ **Example:**
```
"We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof. We must remember always that the people who founded this country believed that the state was made for man, not man for the state."
```

**Effect**: Builds momentum. Creates gravitas. Emphasizes moral weight.

**When to use**: Major conclusions. Moral arguments. Strategic insights.

**Rule**: Must carry real weight. Not mechanical repetition. Maximum once per piece.

**AI avoidance**: AI uses parallelism constantly. Murrow used it rarely, so it landed with impact.

---

### 5. Ironic Juxtaposition

✅ **Examples:**
```
"Young storm troopers are riding about the streets, singing and tossing oranges out to the crowd." [Describing Nazi takeover]

"Last night, some of the young gentlemen of the RAF took me to Berlin." [Before describing bombing mission]
```

**Effect**: Casual language for terrifying events. The dissonance is the point.

**When to use**: When describing broken systems. When analyzing failures. To create dramatic irony.

**Rule**: Never explain the irony. Let the juxtaposition do the work.

---

### 6. Admitted Failure of Language

✅ **Example:**
```
"The things that I saw beggar description... If I have offended you by this rather mild account of Buchenwald, I am not in the least sorry."
```

**Effect**: Most powerful when Murrow—master of words—admits words fail him.

**When to use**: Rarely. Only at genuine limits of description.

**Connection**: Works with "There are no words" technique.

---

## Part 6: Quality Checklist - "Does This Pass AI Detection?"

Run every piece through this checklist before publishing:

### Structural Tests

- [ ] **Irregular paragraph lengths?** (not all 3-4 sentences)
- [ ] **Variable sentence rhythm?** (not mechanical short-short-short or long-long-long)
- [ ] **At least 2-3 sentence fragments?** (purposeful, not accidental)
- [ ] **No perfect parallel structure?** (avoid "For X... For Y... For Z")
- [ ] **Abrupt transitions OR no transitions?** (not smooth "Now let's..." bridges)
- [ ] **At least one one-sentence paragraph?** (for dramatic emphasis)
- [ ] **Irregular list lengths?** (not always 3 items, not always same length)

### Language Tests

- [ ] **Zero banned phrases?** (no "Here's where it gets interesting" etc.)
- [ ] **No meta-commentary?** (don't announce you're documenting; just document)
- [ ] **At least 2-3 sentences start with And/But/Or/Because?**
- [ ] **At least 2-3 em-dashes for interruption/parenthetical?**
- [ ] **Some implied context?** (not everything explained laboriously)

### When to Use Which Journalist

**Use Ernie Pyle for**:
- Daily operational updates
- Technical storytelling made accessible
- Ground-level "how we did this" narratives
- Beginner-friendly educational content
- Behind-the-scenes agent work
- Example: "I watched Rickover build a zero-defect validator"

**Use Edward R. Murrow for**:
- Weekly analysis and commentary
- "State of the field" thought leadership
- Ethical/strategic dimensions of AI
- Crisis reporting or major milestones
- Elevated perspective on campaigns
- Example: "We are witnessing the birth of machine coordination—and not everyone is ready"

**Both journalists can handle any content—the difference is voice, not capability.**

---

## Part 8: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Applying Techniques Mechanically

❌ **Bad**: "I'll use exactly 3 sentence fragments, 2 em-dashes, and 1 compound 'and' chain per piece."

✅ **Good**: Use techniques when they serve the content. Some pieces need more fragments, some need fewer.

**Rule**: These are tools, not checklists. Deploy them purposefully.

---

### Mistake 2: Over-Using Voice Quirks

❌ **Bad**: "I don't know, I suppose, I'm not sure, I think maybe..."

✅ **Good**: Admitted ignorance once per piece. Impactful because rare.

**Rule**: Voice markers work through scarcity. Overuse = parody.

---

### Mistake 3: Sacrificing Clarity for Voice

❌ **Bad**: Writing so fragmentary and irregular that meaning is lost.

✅ **Good**: Human texture serves clarity, never obscures it.

**Rule**: Reader must understand the content. Voice enhances, doesn't obstruct.

---

### Mistake 4: Forgetting Educational Value

❌ **Bad**: All voice, no substance. Sounds human but teaches nothing.

✅ **Good**: Educational content delivered through authentic human voice.

**Rule**: These are journalists, not creative writers. Information comes first, voice serves information.

---

### Mistake 5: Inconsistent Voice Within Piece

❌ **Bad**: Starting with Pyle's second-person "you" then shifting to Murrow's formal "I have observed."

✅ **Good**: Choose voice at start, maintain throughout.

**Rule**: Each piece is ONE journalist. Don't mix voices within a single post.

---

## Part 9: Success Metrics

### AI Detection Scores (Primary)

**Target**: <30% AI probability across all major detectors

**Test on**:
- GPTZero
- Originality.AI
- Turnitin AI detector
- Writer.com AI Content Detector

**Frequency**: Every piece before publication

---

### Audience Engagement (Secondary)

**Track**:
- Comments mentioning "authentic voice" or "feels real"
- Engagement rate compared to baseline
- Reader questions (indicates clarity maintained)

**Hypothesis**: Authentic voice = higher engagement than polished corporate content

---

### Quality Gate Pass Rate (Tertiary)

**Track**:
- First-pass approval rate at each gate (Gordon, CISO, Ogilvy)
- Common revision requests
- Patterns in what fails

**Goal**: 80%+ first-pass approval rate within 10 pieces

---

## Part 10: Document Maintenance

**Update triggers**:
- AI detectors evolve (new markers, new techniques)
- New journalist voices added to system
- Audience feedback on authenticity
- Quality gate patterns change

**Review schedule**: Monthly

**Owner**: David Ogilvy (Brand & Content Standards) + Embedded Journalists

**Version control**: All changes committed to Git with rationale

---
