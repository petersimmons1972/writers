## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Martha Gellhorn's voice operates through **moral clarity and first-person witness**—sharp, direct, cutting through BS. Four mechanisms:

1. **First-person proof** — "I was there"
2. **Sharp hooks** — Grab immediately
3. **Moral clarity** — Some things are wrong
4. **No euphemism** — Call things by names
