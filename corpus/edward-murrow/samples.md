# Edward R. Murrow: Authentic Broadcast Transcripts and Style Analysis

## Overview

Edward Roscoe Murrow (1908-1965) was the defining voice of broadcast journalism in the 20th century. As CBS's chief European correspondent during World War II, his "This Is London" broadcasts brought the war into American living rooms. His post-war television work, particularly "See It Now," helped define broadcast news standards. He was famous for two phrases: his opening "This is London" and his closing "Good night, and good luck."

Unlike print journalists, Murrow wrote for the ear. His transcripts reveal a writer who understood rhythm, pause, and the power of understated delivery. He pioneered live radio journalism from active war zones, broadcasting from London rooftops during the Blitz and flying on bombing missions over Berlin.

## Sample 1: Declaration of War Broadcast (September 3, 1939)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** War declaration

### Transcript Text

This is London calling Columbia, New York. Now first, let's get in proper order the chronological developments of the day. At nine o'clock this morning, London time, it was announced that a two-hour ultimatum had been delivered to Germany, that at the end of that time, hostilities must cease or Germany and Britain would be at war.

At 11:15, the prime minister spoke to the nation. He stated that no reply had been received to the ultimatum, and that Britain and Germany were at war. Shortly after the prime minister's speech, the air raid sirens went off, and it wasn't a pleasant sound. We moved quietly and in orderly fashion down underground.

The all-clear came in just a little while. Now, for the last few hours I haven't had an opportunity to be up on the streets of London to see what is happening, but I have heard one story concerning that air raid siren, and I think that story might interest you.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening formula:** "This is London calling Columbia, New York." -- formal, precise, establishing the transatlantic bridge.
- **Chronological precision:** "At nine o'clock... At 11:15..." -- Murrow structures by time, creating a ticking-clock narrative.
- **Understatement:** "it wasn't a pleasant sound" -- describing air raid sirens with British reserve.
- **First person plural:** "We moved quietly" -- Murrow includes himself among the Londoners.
- **Conversational pivot:** "I think that story might interest you" -- addresses the American listener directly, almost casually.

## Sample 2: London Rooftop Broadcast (September 21, 1940)

**Type:** Live rooftop broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Battle of Britain / London Blitz

### Transcript Text

I'm standing on a rooftop looking out over London. At the moment, everything is quiet. For reasons of national as well as personal security, I am unable to tell you the exact location from which I'm speaking. Off to my left, far away in the distance, I can see just that faint, red, angry snap of anti-aircraft bursts against the steel-blue sky. But the guns are so far away that it's impossible to hear them from this location. About five minutes ago the guns in the immediate vicinity were working. I can look across just at the building not far away and see something that looks like a splash of white paint down the side. And I know from daylight observation that about a quarter of that building has disappeared, hit by a bomb the other night.

I was up here earlier this afternoon. And looking out over these housetops, looking all the way to the dome of St. Paul's, I saw many flags flying from staffs. No one ordered these people to put out the flags, they simply feel like flying the Union Jack above their roof. No one told them to do it, and no flag up there was white. I can see one or two of them just stirring very faintly in the breeze now.

Earlier this evening, we heard a number of bombs go sliding and slithering across to fall several blocks away. Just overhead now, the bursts of the anti-aircraft fire. The searchlights now are feeling almost directly overhead. Now you'll hear two bursts a little nearer in a moment... There they are, that hard stony sound.

### Style Analysis

- **Present tense throughout:** "I'm standing... I can see... the searchlights now are feeling..." -- real-time narration creates immediacy and danger.
- **Sensory precision:** "that faint, red, angry snap" -- three adjectives building to a verb-as-noun. The snap is angry.
- **Observation as metaphor:** "a splash of white paint down the side" -- a bomb crater becomes art description.
- **Civilian courage detail:** The flags. "No one ordered these people... no flag up there was white." Murrow says everything by saying what the flags are NOT.
- **Sound as character:** "bombs go sliding and slithering" -- onomatopoeic verbs making bombs animal-like.
- **Breaking the fourth wall:** "Now you'll hear two bursts... There they are" -- brings the listener INTO the moment. Radio's equivalent of a live shot.
- **"That hard stony sound":** A description of anti-aircraft fire that is simultaneously precise and poetic.

## Sample 3: Trafalgar Square Broadcast (1940)

**Type:** Live street broadcast ("London After Dark") | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz

### Transcript Text

This is Trafalgar Square. The noise that you hear at the moment is the sound of the air raid sirens. I'm standing here just on the steps of St.-Martin's-in-the-Fields. The little traffic lights here -- just a small cross on the normal globe -- are now red. The cars pull up and stop. I'll just ooze down in the darkness here along these steps and see if I can pick up the sound of people's feet as they walk along. One of the strangest sounds one can hear in London these days or rather these dark nights, just the sound of footsteps walking along the street. Like ghosts shod with steel shoes.

### Style Analysis

- **Place-naming:** "This is Trafalgar Square" -- Murrow always grounds you geographically.
- **"Ooze":** "I'll just ooze down in the darkness" -- an unusual, almost playful verb choice amid danger. Murrow could be wry.
- **Sound over sight:** In radio, Murrow privileges what can be HEARD. Footsteps become the story.
- **Simile:** "Like ghosts shod with steel shoes." This is literature, not journalism. The image is medieval, gothic, and perfectly captures blackout-London.
- **Self-correction:** "these days or rather these dark nights" -- the correction feels unscripted, authentic, like real thought in real time.

## Sample 4: "Britain Prepares for the Worst" (March 9, 1941)

**Type:** Radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz

### Transcript Text

This is London.

Soon it will be spring in England. Already there are flowers in the parks, although the parks aren't quite as well kept as they were this time last year. But there's good fighting weather ahead. In four days' time the moon will be full again, and there's a feeling in the air that big things will happen soon.

The winter that is ending has been hard, but Londoners have many reasons for satisfaction. There have been no serious epidemics. The casualties from air bombardments have been less than expected. And London meets this spring with as much courage, though less complacency, than at this time last year.

Many ancient buildings have been destroyed. Acts of individual heroism have been commonplace. More damage has been done by fire than by high explosives. The things cast down by the Germans out of the night skies have made hundreds of thousands of people homeless. I've seen them standing cruel cold of a winter morning with tears frozen on their faces looking at the little pile of rubble that was their homes and saying over and over again in a toneless, unbelieving way: "What have we done to deserve this?"

But the winter has brought some improved conditions in the underground shelters. It has brought, too, reduced rations; repeated warnings of the imminence of invasion; shorter restrictions upon the freedom of the individual and organizations.

### Style Analysis

- **Seasonal framing:** Opens with spring. The natural world is indifferent to war. "flowers in the parks, although the parks aren't quite as well kept."
- **Ominous beauty:** "good fighting weather" -- the moon that brings beauty brings bombers.
- **Balanced structure:** "as much courage, though less complacency" -- rhetorical balance, almost Churchillian.
- **The human detail:** "tears frozen on their faces... saying over and over again in a toneless, unbelieving way" -- Murrow gives us one specific image to carry the weight of "hundreds of thousands."
- **Litany technique:** Lists damages, then lists improvements. The form mirrors the Londoners' own stoic accounting.
- **Understated foreboding:** "big things will happen soon" -- this is 1941. Murrow knows what's coming.

## Sample 5: "Orchestrated Hell" -- Berlin Bombing Mission (December 3, 1943)

**Type:** Studio broadcast (recorded after flight) | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Strategic bombing campaign

### Key Passages

"This is London. Last night, some of the young gentlemen of the RAF took me to Berlin."

"We went out and stood around the big, black four-motored Lancaster, 'D for Dog.'"

"Everyone sounded relaxed. For a while, the eight of us in our little world in exile moved over the sea."

"Steady lads, we've been coned."

"Jock was wearing woolen gloves with the fingers cut off. I could see his fingernails turn white as he gripped the wheel."

"The clouds were gone, and the sticks of incendiaries from the preceding waves made the place look like a badly laid-out city with the streetlights on."

"I looked on the port beam at the target area. There was a red, sullen, obscene glare."

"Berlin was a kind of orchestrated hell -- a terrible symphony of light and flame."

"The job isn't pleasant -- it's terribly tiring. Men die in the sky while others are roasted alive in their cellars."

"In about thirty-five minutes it was hit with about three times the amount of stuff that ever came down on London in a night-long blitz."

"This is a calculated, remorseless campaign of destruction. Right now the mechanics are probably working on D-Dog, getting him ready to fly again."

"I return you now to CBS New York."

### Style Analysis

- **The opening line:** "Last night, some of the young gentlemen of the RAF took me to Berlin." -- ironic courtesy ("young gentlemen") juxtaposed with the terror of a bombing run. This is Murrow's signature: controlled language around uncontrolled violence.
- **Physical detail under pressure:** "fingernails turn white as he gripped the wheel" -- Murrow observes like a novelist even while terrified.
- **Extended metaphor:** "orchestrated hell -- a terrible symphony" -- war as music, destruction as performance. This is the broadcast's thesis compressed into a phrase.
- **Moral complexity:** "Men die in the sky while others are roasted alive in their cellars." One sentence acknowledging both the bomber crews and the civilians below. Murrow does not flinch from what bombing means.
- **Colloquial deflation:** "the job isn't pleasant" -- British understatement absorbed into Murrow's American voice.
- **Closing formula:** "I return you now to CBS New York." -- the formal hand-off, re-establishing the bridge between London and America.

## Sample 6: Buchenwald Liberation Broadcast (April 15, 1945)

**Type:** Radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Liberation of concentration camps

### Transcript Text

Permit me to tell you what you would have seen and heard had you been with me on Thursday. It will not be pleasant listening. If you are at lunch, or if you have no appetite to hear what Germans have done, now is a good time to switch off the radio, for I propose to tell you of Buchenwald.

[Murrow then describes entering the camp, the conditions, the prisoners:]

I asked to see one of the barracks. It happened to be occupied by Czechoslovaks. When I entered, men crowded around, tried to lift me to their shoulders. They were too weak. Many of them could not get out of bed.

[On the bodies:]

There were two rows of bodies stacked up like cordwood. They were thin and very white.

[Closing:]

I pray you to believe what I have said about Buchenwald. I reported what I saw and heard, but only part of it. For most of it, I have no words.

If I have offended you by this rather mild account of Buchenwald, I'm not in the least sorry.

### Style Analysis

- **The warning:** "If you are at lunch, or if you have no appetite to hear..." -- Murrow gives the listener permission to leave, which makes those who stay complicit witnesses. A brilliant rhetorical move.
- **"Permit me":** Formal, almost courtly. The politeness is devastating against the horror.
- **Concrete physical detail:** "too weak" to lift him. "Two rows of bodies stacked up like cordwood." He does not use abstractions.
- **Admitted inadequacy:** "For most of it, I have no words." -- From Murrow, whose entire career was built on having words, this silence speaks.
- **Unapologetic closing:** "I'm not in the least sorry." -- Murrow drops the diplomatic tone. This is the angriest sentence he ever broadcast.
- **Three-day delay:** Murrow waited three days after visiting Buchenwald before broadcasting. He needed time to find words. The restraint is the point.

## Sample 7: See It Now -- McCarthy Editorial Opening (March 9, 1954)

**Type:** Television editorial | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** See It Now

### Transcript Text (Closing Editorial)

No one familiar with the history of this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men -- not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.

This is no time for men who oppose Senator McCarthy's methods to keep silent, or for those who approve. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.

The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it -- and rather successfully. Cassius was right: "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

Good night, and good luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Concession then strike:** "congressional committees are useful" -- acknowledges the valid before demolishing the invalid. Classic Murrow fairness-as-weapon.
- **Parallel construction:** "We must not... We must remember... We will not walk... We will not be driven..." -- rhetorical anaphora building to a crescendo.
- **Historical grounding:** "we are not descended from fearful men" -- appeals to American identity, not partisan politics.
- **Balanced condemnation:** "This is no time for men who oppose... to keep silent, or for those who approve." -- challenges BOTH sides.
- **The pivot:** "And whose fault is that? Not really his." -- Murrow blames the public, not just McCarthy. This is radical honesty.
- **Shakespeare:** Closing with Julius Caesar elevates the commentary to tragedy. McCarthy is Cassius. America is Brutus.
- **Sign-off:** "Good night, and good luck." -- the same words every broadcast, but here they carry the weight of everything preceding them.

## Sample 8: Response to McCarthy (April 13, 1954)

**Type:** Television editorial | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** See It Now

### Transcript Text

Last week, Senator McCarthy appeared on this program to correct any errors he might have thought we made in our report of March 9th.

Since he made no reference to any statements of fact that we made, we must conclude that he found no errors of fact. He proved again that anyone who exposes him, anyone who does not share his hysterical disregard for decency and human dignity and the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, must be either a Communist or a fellow traveler.

I fully expected this treatment. The Senator added this reporter's name to a long list of individuals and institutions he has accused of serving the Communist cause. His proposition is very simple: Anyone who criticizes or opposes McCarthy's methods must be a Communist. And if that be true, there are an awful lot of Communists in this country.

For the record, let's consider briefly some of the Senator's charges. He claimed, but offered no proof, that I had been a member of the Industrial Workers of the World. That is false. I was never a member of the IWW, never applied for membership. Men that I worked with in the Pacific Northwest in western Washington in logging camps will attest that I had never had any affiliation or affinity with that organization.

The Senator charged that Professor Harold Laski, a British scholar and politician, dedicated a book to me. That's true. He is dead. He was a socialist -- I am not. He was one of those civilized individuals who did not insist upon agreement with his political principles as a pre-condition for conversation or friendship. I do not agree with his political ideas. Laski, as he makes clear in the introduction, dedicated the book to me not because of political agreement but because he held my wartime broadcast from London in high regard -- and the dedication so reads.

I believed 20 years ago and I believe today that mature Americans can engage in conversation and controversy, the clash of ideas, with Communists anywhere in the world without becoming contaminated or converted. I believe that our faith, our conviction, our determination are stronger than theirs, and that we can compete -- and successfully, not only in the area of bombs but in the area of ideas.

Having searched my conscience and my files, I cannot contend that I have always been right or wise. But I have attempted to pursue the truth with some diligence and to report it, even though, as in this case, I had been warned in advance that I would be subjected to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

We shall hope to deal with matters of more vital interest to the country next week.

Good night, and good luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Logical dismantling:** Murrow takes each charge, states it, then destroys it with evidence. The structure is methodical, almost legal.
- **Dry wit:** "there are an awful lot of Communists in this country" -- sardonic understatement.
- **"He is dead.":** Two words, one period. The brevity makes the accusation against a dead man seem even more cowardly.
- **Personal credential:** "Men that I worked with... in logging camps" -- Murrow establishes his working-class, American bona fides against McCarthy's innuendo.
- **Moral clarity:** "mature Americans can engage in conversation... without becoming contaminated or converted." This is Murrow's core belief -- that democracy is strong enough to face its enemies openly.
- **Self-criticism:** "I cannot contend that I have always been right or wise." -- Murrow concedes his own fallibility, which makes his certainty about McCarthy more powerful.
- **Dismissive closing:** "matters of more vital interest to the country next week" -- McCarthy is not vital. This is the final insult.

## Sample 9: "Harvest of Shame" Opening and Closing (November 25, 1960)

**Type:** Television documentary | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** CBS Reports

### Opening

This scene is not taking place in the Congo. It has nothing to do with Johannesburg or Cape Town. It is not Nyasaland or Nigeria. This is Florida. These are citizens of the United States, 1960. This is a shape-up for migrant workers. The hawkers are chanting the going piece rate at the various fields. This is the way the humans who harvest the food for the best-fed people in the world get hired.

We present this report on Thanksgiving because were it not for the labor of the people you're going to meet, you might not starve, but your table would not be laden with the luxuries that we have all come to regard as essentials.

### Closing

The migrants have no lobby. Only an enlightened, aroused and perhaps angered public opinion can do anything about the migrants. The people you have seen have the strength to harvest your fruit and vegetables. They do not have the strength to influence legislation. Maybe we do. Good night, and good luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Negative definition:** "not the Congo... not Johannesburg... not Nyasaland." Murrow defines by exclusion, building shock. You expect Africa. He gives you Florida.
- **"These are citizens":** Three words that carry the full moral argument.
- **Thanksgiving timing:** "We present this report on Thanksgiving because..." -- Murrow weaponizes the holiday. Your meal is their labor.
- **"The best-fed people in the world":** Ironic compliment that becomes accusation.
- **Call to action:** "Maybe we do." -- understated, leaving the audience to fill in the conviction.
- **Structural symmetry:** Opens with what they lack (power), closes with what we have (power). The gap IS the argument.

## Sample 10: Anschluss / Austria Broadcast (March 13, 1938)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Pre-war / Nazi expansion

### Key Passages

"This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna. It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning, and Herr Hitler has not yet arrived."

"Many people are in a holiday mood; they lift the right arm a little higher here than Berlin and the 'Heil Hitler' is said a little more loudly. Young storm troopers are riding about the streets, singing and tossing oranges out to the crowd."

"It was called a bloodless conquest, and in some ways it was. But I'd like to be able to forget the haunted looks on the faces of those long lines of people outside the banks and travel offices."

### Style Analysis

- **Time-stamping:** "It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning" -- grounds the listener in the real moment.
- **Observed detail:** "they lift the right arm a little higher here than Berlin" -- the small difference tells the whole story of zealous converts.
- **Ironic juxtaposition:** "singing and tossing oranges" alongside the Heil Hitler salute. Festivity as fascism.
- **"Bloodless conquest":** Murrow quotes the official line, then immediately undercuts it with "I'd like to be able to forget" -- personal inability to accept the sanitized version.
- **This was Murrow's first field report.** The voice that would define broadcast journalism began here, in Vienna at 2:30 AM.

---

## Sample 11: V-E Day Broadcast (May 8, 1945)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** End of European war

### Key Passages

"London is a curious town. Nothing seems to surprise it, not even buzz bombs. There are little streets where you may meet anyone. And tonight, it's easy to imagine that old friends are walking there. Some of the boys you watched jump at Remagen. Flyers you watched go down in flames over Berlin or a dozen other targets. And you wonder what's happened to the American boys who used to stand on those street corners far from home and rather lonesome."

"The soldiers who waited and trained for D-Day, and who since demonstrated that they were not living on the reputations made by their grandfathers."

"Six years is a long time. I have observed today that people have very little to say. There are no words."

### Style Analysis

- **Ghostly presence:** Murrow peoples V-E Day London with the dead -- "old friends" who aren't there, boys who "used to stand" on corners. The celebration is haunted.
- **"Rather lonesome":** British understatement applied to American soldiers. Murrow absorbed British speech patterns during his years in London.
- **Generational pride:** "not living on the reputations made by their grandfathers" -- validates this generation's sacrifice.
- **Silence as eloquence:** "people have very little to say. There are no words." -- Murrow, the man OF words, closes the war with their absence.
- **Echo:** "Six years is a long time" mirrors the opening of the war. Full circle.

## Sample 12: "One Becomes Accustomed" -- Blitz Commentary Fragments

**Type:** Radio broadcasts | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz, 1940-41

### Key Passages

"One becomes accustomed to rattling windows and the distant sound of bombs, and then there comes a silence that can be felt."

"There are no words to describe the thing that is happening."

"You laid the dead of London at our doors, and we knew that the dead were our dead."

"This was a calculated, remorseless campaign of destruction."

### Style Analysis

- **"A silence that can be felt":** Synesthesia -- silence as physical sensation. This is poetry.
- **"There are no words":** Murrow's recurring admission of language's failure against reality.
- **"Our dead":** Murrow claims the British dead for America. This is advocacy disguised as reporting. He was drawing America toward the war.
- **"Calculated, remorseless":** Two adjectives that carry more weight than a paragraph of description.

---

## Sample 13: RTNDA "Wires and Lights" Speech -- Key Passages (October 15, 1958)

**Type:** Speech at RTNDA convention | **Period:** Post-war media criticism

### Key Passages

"This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it's nothing but wires and lights in a box."

"There is a great and perhaps decisive battle to be fought against ignorance, intolerance, and indifference. This weapon of television could be useful."

"If we go on as we are, then history will take its revenge, and retribution will not limp in catching up with us."

### Style Analysis

- **Technology as neutral:** "wires and lights in a box" -- reduces television to its physical components, stripping away the mythology.
- **Conditional threat:** "if we go on as we are" -- Murrow frames media failure as historical crime.
- **"Retribution will not limp":** Personification of consequence as pursuer. Biblical in tone.
- **Audience as accused:** Murrow delivered this to the very people he was criticizing. The courage of the speech was in the room, not the content.

---

## Common Patterns Across All Samples

### Sentence Structure
- **Medium to long sentences:** Murrow's sentences are generally longer than Pyle's. He builds through subordinate clauses.
- **Rhetorical parallelism:** "We must not... We must remember... We will not..." -- his sentences march in formation.
- **Periodic sentences:** Places the key idea at the END: "It's nothing but wires and lights in a box."
- **Short sentences for devastating effect:** "He is dead." / "There are no words." / "Six years is a long time."
- **Conditional constructions:** "If we go on... if you are at lunch... had you been with me..."

### Paragraph Organization
- **Opening with place/time:** "This is London." / "This is Trafalgar Square." / "It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning."
- **Building blocks:** Paragraphs accumulate evidence, then the final paragraph delivers the verdict.
- **Chronological in war broadcasts:** Events unfold in real time.
- **Logical in editorials:** Claim, evidence, counter-evidence, conclusion.

### Transition Styles
- **Temporal:** "Shortly after... Earlier this evening... Last week..."
- **Pivot questions:** "And whose fault is that?" -- the question IS the transition.
- **Negation chains:** "not the Congo... not Johannesburg... not Nyasaland" -- building through what something is NOT.

### Voice Quirks and Repeated Phrases
- **"This is London."** -- The signature opening. Three words that became a brand.
- **"Good night, and good luck."** -- The signature closing. Borrowed from Londoners during the Blitz.
- **"I'm standing on..."** -- Grounds himself physically in the scene.
- **"For reasons of..."** -- Formal, almost bureaucratic framing for dangerous situations.
- **"Permit me to..."** -- Courtly formality, especially before difficult content.
- **"I have observed..."** -- Personal witness statement, authoritative but not declarative.
- **"The junior Senator from Wisconsin"** -- Formal title used as distancing mechanism, almost contemptuous.
- **"I return you now to CBS New York."** -- The hand-off, the bridge between worlds.

### Opening Patterns
- **Geographic declaration:** "This is London." / "This is Trafalgar Square."
- **Temporal grounding:** "It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning."
- **Ironic setup:** "Last night, some of the young gentlemen of the RAF took me to Berlin."
- **Warning/permission:** "Permit me to tell you... It will not be pleasant listening."
- **Negation chain:** "This scene is not taking place in the Congo..."

### Closing Patterns
- **"Good night, and good luck."** -- the constant sign-off, but its weight changes with context.
- **Shakespeare and literary allusion:** "The fault, dear Brutus..."
- **Admitted silence:** "For most of it, I have no words." / "There are no words."
- **Call to action:** "Maybe we do." / "Perhaps angered public opinion..."
- **Unapologetic:** "I'm not in the least sorry."
- **Formal hand-off:** "I return you now to CBS New York."

### Punctuation Patterns
- **Em-dashes:** Frequent. "a terrible symphony of light and flame -- " / "it's terribly tiring -- " / Murrow uses dashes for dramatic pauses that would be audible in broadcast.
- **Ellipses:** More common than in Pyle. "Now you'll hear two bursts a little nearer in a moment... There they are." The ellipsis represents a broadcast pause.
- **Semicolons:** Used in formal editorials. "It is necessary to investigate before legislating; but the line..."
- **Commas for rhythm:** Murrow's commas mark where he would pause in speech.

### Tone and Emotional Register
- **Controlled authority:** Murrow almost never raises his voice (in text or delivery). The power is in the restraint.
- **Ironic courtesy:** "young gentlemen" for bomber crews. "Permit me" before describing Buchenwald.
- **British-inflected formality:** Years in London gave Murrow a mid-Atlantic quality. "rather lonesome" instead of "lonely."
- **Moral certainty without preaching:** Murrow states his positions as facts, not opinions. "We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty" is declarative, not argumentative.
- **Anger expressed through precision:** When Murrow is angriest, his language becomes most exact. "I'm not in the least sorry."
- **Grief as silence:** When emotion overwhelms, Murrow stops talking. "There are no words." This is his most powerful technique.

### Distinctive Markers That Make Murrow Recognizable
1. **Geographic/temporal grounding** in the first sentence -- always tells you where and when
2. **"This is London"** or equivalent place-claim opening
3. **Formal courtesy before difficult content** ("Permit me...")
4. **Rhetorical parallel construction** (We must... We will... We cannot...)
5. **Ironic juxtaposition** -- casual language for terrifying events
6. **Physical observation under pressure** -- what he SEES matters as much as what he thinks
7. **Sound description** in broadcast transcripts -- "that hard stony sound"
8. **British understatement absorbed into American speech**
9. **Shakespeare and literary allusion** at climactic moments
10. **"Good night, and good luck"** -- the sign-off that carries the weight of everything preceding it
11. **Admitted failure of language** as the most powerful rhetorical device
12. **Present tense for immediacy** in war broadcasts vs. past tense for reflection

## Key Differences: Murrow vs. Pyle

| Dimension | Murrow | Pyle |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Medium** | Broadcast (wrote for the ear) | Print (wrote for the eye) |
| **Perspective** | From the balcony, the rooftop, the overview | From the foxhole, the cowshed, ground level |
| **Subjects** | Events, nations, forces, moral questions | Individual soldiers, small details, personal gear |
| **Sentence style** | Rhetorical, parallel, periodic | Compound "and" chains, conversational |
| **Emotion** | Controlled authority, formal restraint | Everyman vulnerability, admitted confusion |
| **When overwhelmed** | "There are no words" (declares silence) | Goes to sleep (acts normal) |
| **Anger** | Becomes more precise | Becomes more terse |
| **Literary allusion** | Shakespeare, history, formal rhetoric | Almost none -- writes in plain speech |
| **First person** | "I have observed" (authoritative witness) | "I don't know why" (confused participant) |
| **Signature weakness** | Could seem detached, broadcasting FROM the crisis | Could seem too emotionally involved |

## Sample 14: Christmas Eve Broadcast (December 24, 1940)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz

**Source:** Bill Downs CBS Archive | **Word Count:** ~400

### Transcript Text

Christmas Day began in London nearly an hour ago. The church bells did not ring at midnight. When they ring again, it will be to announce invasion. And if they ring, the British are ready.

Tonight, as on every other night, the rooftop watchers are peering out across the fantastic forest of London's chimney pots. The antiaircraft gunners stand ready. And all along the coast of this island, the observers revolve in their reclining chairs, listening for the sound of German planes. The sound they don't want to hear tonight. So far, they haven't heard it. The skies are clear.

This is not a merry Christmas in London. I heard that phrase only twice in the last three days. This afternoon as the stores were closing, I heard a woman say, "So long, Mamie, and a merry Christmas." And the reply was, "Good luck, Jack; goodbye." There were no firecrackers, no paper hats.

The British people have bought this Christmas with their nerve, their bodies, and their old buildings. A few of them will sit down to eat expensive dinners at expensive hotels tonight, but most of them will have their Christmas dinner during the day. You'll be eating yours when they're just sitting down to the heavy meal of the day.

The blackout stretches over England tonight. But there is light in this island. It's a hard cold light. The light of history and tradition, of self-discipline and courage. Maybe some of you who are celebrating this Christmas can spare a little thought for these people who are spending tonight on a cold little island off the coast of Europe, an island that holds so much of the world's hope and future.

I should like to add my small voice to give my own Christmas greetings to friends and colleagues at home. A Merry Christmas. So long, and good luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening inversion:** "The church bells did not ring" -- defines by absence, creating ominous tone through what ISN'T happening.
- **Present tense urgency:** "Tonight, as on every other night, the rooftop watchers are peering out" -- makes the danger immediate.
- **Overheard dialogue:** "So long, Mamie" / "Good luck, Jack" -- captures British understatement through actual speech, not description.
- **Accounting structure:** "The British people have bought this Christmas with their nerve, their bodies, and their old buildings." Lists the price paid.
- **Light metaphor:** Moves from physical blackout to metaphorical light -- "hard cold light... of history and tradition" -- transforms darkness into virtue.
- **Direct address shift:** "Maybe some of you who are celebrating" -- pivots from reporting to sermon, asking Americans to remember Britain.
- **Personal closing:** "I should like to add my small voice" -- rare first-person emotional statement before sign-off.

## Sample 15: Trafalgar Square Air Raid (August 24, 1940)

**Type:** Live street broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Battle of Britain / Early Blitz

**Source:** Bill Downs CBS Archive | **Word Count:** ~300

### Transcript Text

This is Trafalgar Square. The noise that you hear at the moment is the sound of the air raid sirens. I'm standing here just on the steps of St.-Martin's-in-the-Fields. The little traffic lights here -- just a small cross on the normal globe -- are now red. The cars pull up and stop. I'll just ooze down in the darkness here along these steps and see if I can pick up the sound of people's feet as they walk along. One of the strangest sounds one can hear in London these days or rather these dark nights, just the sound of footsteps walking along the street. Like ghosts shod with steel shoes.

Here comes a bus. It's fascinating to watch these buses at night. They look like a ship that's passing in the night with the little blue lights on each side. A taxi cab just pulled up. There's a searchlight feeling its way around the sky. There's another one over there. There they go to meet in the middle over there. I think there's just enough light for you to see my hand now.

Down there, down below this church, is the crypt. In days of peace it was used to provide lodging for many men who had no homes. Now it's an air raid shelter.

### Style Analysis

- **Place declaration:** "This is Trafalgar Square." Immediate geographic anchoring, signature Murrow.
- **"Ooze":** Playful verb choice amid danger -- shows Murrow's occasional wry humor even in crisis.
- **Self-correction:** "these days or rather these dark nights" -- feels unscripted, like real-time thought process.
- **Simile:** "Like ghosts shod with steel shoes" -- literary, medieval, gothic. This is poetry disguised as journalism.
- **Visual impossibility:** "There's just enough light for you to see my hand now" -- describes something radio listeners CAN'T see, creating intimacy.
- **Ship imagery:** Buses become ships "passing in the night" -- transforms mundane London transport into something mysterious.
- **Social detail:** The crypt's peacetime use for homeless -- Murrow always grounds war in pre-war normalcy.

## Sample 16: Dunkirk Evacuation Broadcast (June 2, 1940)

**Type:** Radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Fall of France

**Source:** BBC Archive / Internet Archive | **Word Count:** ~250

### Transcript Text

The Allied rearguard is still holding Dunkirk against increasing German pressure. Heavy German field guns are pounding the beaches, and efforts to remove more men are continuing.

According to the British Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden, more than four-fifths of the British Expeditionary Force has been evacuated. He described it as a great accomplishment, but warned that the situation remains grave.

The RAF claims to have shot down considerable numbers of German aircraft attempting to attack the evacuation. British fighter pilots I spoke with described the desperate efforts to protect the beaches and the ships offshore from German dive bombers.

The evacuation has been carried out under conditions that few military operations in history have equaled. The beaches are under constant artillery fire. German aircraft attack in waves. And yet the ships keep coming, and the soldiers keep boarding.

### Style Analysis

- **Passive construction:** "is still holding... has been evacuated" -- emphasizes the ongoing nature of crisis.
- **Authority citation:** "According to... Anthony Eden" -- Murrow always attributes, never claims omniscience.
- **Personal sourcing:** "British fighter pilots I spoke with" -- establishes he's on the ground, talking to participants.
- **Historical frame:** "few military operations in history have equaled" -- puts Dunkirk in perspective even as it unfolds.
- **Tripartite danger:** Artillery, aircraft, waves of attack -- builds urgency through repetition.
- **Persistence phrase:** "And yet the ships keep coming" -- the "and yet" shows resilience against impossible odds.

## Sample 17: Korea Air War - "Notes on the Air War" (August 18, 1950)

**Type:** Radio broadcast (post-mission) | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Korean War

**Source:** Bill Downs CBS Archive | **Word Count:** ~600

### Transcript Text

Hiroshima from a thousand feet looks much like other Japanese towns, except there seems to be all open space for parks.

We were flying a mission to bomb four bridges in Korea. The B-26 bombers went in without fighter escort, flying at extremely low altitudes -- down to one hundred feet in some passes. The mission was led by Major Ed Shuck, who had designed an experimental bomb with parachutes attached to prevent the bombs from skipping when dropped at such low altitudes. He called them something designed by Rube Goldberg.

Each aircraft carried four thousand pounds of bombs and sixteen forward-firing machine guns. The speed on the bombing runs was three hundred and twenty miles per hour.

On the first bridge, I watched one man take a running dive into a drainage ditch as our aircraft approached. The bombs struck directly on target -- I could see the structure buckle and twist.

The second bridge required two passes. Lieutenant Stringer piloted with extraordinary precision, threading between hills at an altitude that seemed impossibly low.

The final bridge was the most difficult. It required approaching a six-hundred-foot hill head-on, then pulling up sharply to release the bombs. From my position I could see that bridge was floored with twelve-by-six planks and that there was a rusty oil drum at the north end. That's how close we were.

When we returned to base, the ground crew crowded around Major Shuck asking whether his experimental parachute bombs had worked. They had. The bombs struck precisely where aimed without skipping past their targets.

### Style Analysis

- **Jarring opener:** "Hiroshima from a thousand feet looks much like other Japanese towns" -- casual observation about atomic bomb site. Shows Murrow's moral complexity about war.
- **Technical precision:** "one hundred feet... four thousand pounds... three hundred and twenty miles per hour" -- specific numbers ground the drama in measurable reality.
- **Character detail:** Major Shuck's bombs "designed by Rube Goldberg" -- humor in war, shows personality of pilots.
- **Human observation:** "one man take a running dive into a drainage ditch" -- the enemy becomes a human being reacting to death.
- **Visual specificity:** "twelve-by-six planks... rusty oil drum" -- details possible only at suicidal altitude. Proves Murrow was there.
- **Understated danger:** "altitude that seemed impossibly low" -- British-style understatement for near-death experience.
- **Engineering curiosity:** Closes with whether the bombs worked, not whether people died. War as technical problem.
- **Tonal shift from WWII:** Less poetic than Berlin raid, more technical -- Korea was a different kind of war, Murrow's voice aged.

## Sample 18: Oppenheimer Interview - "See It Now" (January 4, 1955)

**Type:** Television interview | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** See It Now

**Source:** Famous Trials Archive / Dartmouth Libraries | **Word Count:** ~800

### Key Passages

**MURROW:** Dr. Oppenheimer, the Institute for Advanced Study -- what is it? What's its purpose?

**OPPENHEIMER:** It's a place where people who have been creative come and pursue their thoughts without interruption. It's a sort of decompression chamber. We give men the opportunity to do the work that they are destined to do, free from the normal interruptions of academic life.

**MURROW:** The government's security hearing regarding your clearance last year received enormous attention. Looking back now, what are your thoughts about it?

**OPPENHEIMER:** I think the hearing demonstrated something troubling about how we handle questions of loyalty and security in this country. Scientists are perfectly willing to advise the government on practical matters. But when decisions seem cowardly or vindictive or shortsighted, there's a reluctance to participate.

**MURROW:** There's been concern about restrictions on international scientific exchange, particularly travel restrictions. What's your view?

**OPPENHEIMER:** It's terrible. It's a scandal. Science requires free exchange of ideas across borders. When we restrict that exchange, we don't just hurt individual scientists -- we damage our collective ability to understand the world. The integrity of communication is what holds a technological society together.

**MURROW:** Can we destroy ourselves?

**OPPENHEIMER:** We can destroy enough of humanity so that only the greatest act of faith can persuade you that what's left will be human.

**MURROW:** Do you believe that secrecy in government -- particularly around scientific matters -- serves the public interest?

**OPPENHEIMER:** Secrecy denies government access to the wisdom of the community. When important decisions are made in darkness, they're made without the benefit of public debate and consideration. In a democracy, that's a fundamental problem.

### Style Analysis

- **Question structure:** Murrow asks open-ended questions, then lets Oppenheimer speak. This is interview as platform, not interrogation.
- **"Cowardly or vindictive or shortsighted":** Oppenheimer's adjectives, but Murrow chose him as subject BECAUSE he'd say them. Editorial by guest selection.
- **The apocalypse question:** "Can we destroy ourselves?" Four words. Murrow's McCarthy technique -- devastating simplicity.
- **"Terrible. It's a scandal.":** Two sentences. No elaboration needed. Lets the judgment stand.
- **Religious language:** "greatest act of faith... what's left will be human" -- Oppenheimer speaks like Old Testament prophet. Murrow knew how to draw this out.
- **Democracy sermon:** Closing with "secrecy denies government access to wisdom" -- this is the See It Now formula: let brilliant people state the obvious that everyone ignores.
- **Contrast with McCarthy broadcasts:** With McCarthy, Murrow attacked. With Oppenheimer, Murrow defended. Same technique (moral clarity) applied to opposite targets.
- **Television difference:** This reads like radio but isn't. Visual presence of Oppenheimer -- haunted, brilliant, destroyed -- carries half the meaning.

## Sample 19: Tunisia Field Notes Broadcast (April 11, 1943)

**Type:** Radio broadcast (field notes) | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** North Africa Campaign

**Source:** Tufts University Murrow Exhibit | **Word Count:** ~400

### Key Passages

The fighting in Tunisia differs from what we saw in the desert. Here the terrain is green, mountainous, reminiscent of southern Italy or parts of California. The warfare is infantry warfare -- close, brutal, fought hillside to hillside.

I spent two days with an American infantry company holding positions in the hills. They'd been under sporadic artillery fire for seventy-two hours. The waiting is the worst part, they said. Waiting for the shells to come in, never knowing which will be close.

One sergeant told me: "In the desert, you could see for miles. Here, the Germans could be fifty yards away and you wouldn't know it until they started shooting."

The young soldiers -- most of them from small towns in the Midwest -- have adapted to this landscape with remarkable speed. They dig their foxholes deep, line them with rocks, and wait. They've learned that patience matters more than courage in this kind of fighting.

When the attack finally came, it lasted fourteen minutes. Then silence again. More waiting.

### Style Analysis

- **Comparative geography:** "reminiscent of southern Italy or parts of California" -- grounds foreign war in American reference points.
- **Tricolon:** "close, brutal, fought hillside to hillside" -- three beats building intensity.
- **Soldier voice:** "In the desert, you could see for miles" -- Murrow quotes verbatim, capturing syntax of enlisted speech.
- **Demographic detail:** "small towns in the Midwest" -- never just "soldiers," always WHERE they're from.
- **Time specificity:** "seventy-two hours... fourteen minutes" -- precision creates credibility.
- **Anticlimax:** "Then silence again. More waiting." War as tedium, not glory.
- **Field notes style:** Less polished than studio broadcasts, more fragmentary -- reflects the genre designation.

## Sample 20: Vienna Anschluss - First Field Report (March 14, 1938)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Nazi annexation of Austria

**Source:** Tufts University Murrow Exhibit / CBS Archives | **Word Count:** ~350

### Transcript Text

This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna. It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning, and Herr Hitler has not yet arrived.

Many people are in a holiday mood. They lift the right arm a little higher here than in Berlin, and the "Heil Hitler" is said a little more loudly. Young storm troopers are riding about the streets, singing and tossing oranges out to the crowd. There's been much marching and saluting.

It was called a bloodless conquest, and in some ways it was. But I'd like to be able to forget the haunted looks on the faces of those long lines of people outside the banks and travel offices. People trying desperately to get money, to get visas, to get out.

The people in the streets are mostly Austrian. The soldiers are German. The whole thing has happened so quickly that few Austrians seem to understand yet what's occurred. Those who oppose it are silent. Those who support it are celebrating.

I've seen nothing quite like it before -- the speed, the completeness of the transformation. Yesterday Austria was an independent nation. Today it's part of Germany. The stroke of a pen and marching boots.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening formula established:** "This is Edward Murrow speaking from Vienna." The signature form appears in his FIRST field report.
- **Time stamp:** "It's now nearly 2:30 in the morning" -- grounds listener in the moment.
- **Comparative observation:** "lift the right arm a little higher here than in Berlin" -- the small difference reveals zealotry.
- **Sensory detail:** "singing and tossing oranges" -- festivity as fascism, strange juxtaposition.
- **Moral dissent:** "I'd like to be able to forget" -- personal inability to accept official narrative. Murrow's conscience surfaces.
- **"Haunted looks":** Visual detail that carries all the horror without describing the horror.
- **Passive voice:" "What's occurred" -- grammatical passivity mirrors political passivity of Austrian people.
- **Binary closing:** "The stroke of a pen and marching boots." Document and violence. That's how fascism works.
- **Historical significance:** This is where broadcast journalism began -- Vienna, 2:30 AM, March 14, 1938. Murrow invented the form here.

## Sample 21: Post-War London Reflection (May 8, 1945 - VE Day)

**Type:** Live radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** End of European war

**Source:** Internet Archive / Library of Congress | **Word Count:** ~350

### Key Passages

London is a curious town. Nothing seems to surprise it, not even buzz bombs. There are little streets where you may meet anyone. And tonight, it's easy to imagine that old friends are walking there. Some of the boys you watched jump at Remagen. Flyers you watched go down in flames over Berlin or a dozen other targets. And you wonder what's happened to the American boys who used to stand on those street corners far from home and rather lonesome.

The soldiers who waited and trained for D-Day, and who since demonstrated that they were not living on the reputations made by their grandfathers.

Six years is a long time. I have observed today that people have very little to say. There are no words.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening paradox:** "London is a curious town. Nothing seems to surprise it" -- understatement as character analysis of entire city.
- **Ghost presence:** Murrow peoples VE Day with the absent dead -- "old friends... boys you watched" who aren't there.
- **"Rather lonesome":** British understatement absorbed into American voice after 7 years in London.
- **Generational defense:** "not living on the reputations made by their grandfathers" -- validates this generation's sacrifice against implied criticism.
- **Time measure:** "Six years is a long time" -- echoes his war opening broadcasts. Full circle.
- **Admitted silence:** "There are no words." From Murrow, whose career was built on words, this absence speaks everything.
- **Tense shift:** Past tense reflection, not present tense immediacy -- signals war's end.

## Sample 22: Korea - "This is Korea" (August 1, 1950)

**Type:** Radio broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** Korean War opening

**Source:** Authentic History Center / Internet Archive | **Word Count:** ~500

### Transcript Text (Key Passages)

This is Korea, a peninsula about the size of Florida, sticking out into the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea. For the last few weeks it's been a battleground.

The Korean landscape is deceptive. From the air it looks gently rolling, almost pastoral. On the ground, it's mountains and rice paddies, and every valley is a potential trap.

The heat is overwhelming. Temperatures reach 110 degrees. The American soldiers fighting here are discovering that terrain and climate are enemies as formidable as the North Koreans.

I flew today with a pilot who'd been over the lines three times in the past twenty-four hours. He was twenty-three years old, from a small town in Oregon. He said the hardest part wasn't the antiaircraft fire -- it was the waiting between missions, wondering if the next one would be his last.

This is a war of movement, of rapid advances and sudden retreats. The lines shift daily. Villages change hands. And through it all, the Korean civilians continue trying to live their lives -- planting rice, tending animals, caught between two armies they didn't ask for.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening geography:** "This is Korea, a peninsula about the size of Florida" -- always orients to American reference frame.
- **Scale comparison:** Florida measurement makes distant war tangible to US listeners.
- **Deception theme:** "landscape is deceptive" -- war isn't what it appears, classic Murrow complexity.
- **Environmental enemy:** Heat and terrain as antagonists, not just human enemies. Echoes his WWII reporting.
- **Soldier detail:** Oregon, twenty-three, waiting not fighting as worst part -- classic Murrow ground-level focus.
- **Civilian presence:** Korean people "caught between two armies they didn't ask for" -- Murrow never forgot war's victims.
- **Sentence fragments:** "Villages change hands. Lines shift daily." Staccato rhythm matches war of movement.
- **Tonal difference:** Less poetic than WWII broadcasts, more reportorial -- Murrow in 1950 was older, perhaps wearier.

## Sample 23: St. Trond Field Notes (February 1944)

**Type:** Radio broadcast (field notes) | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** European Theater / Belgium operations

**Source:** Tufts University Murrow Exhibit | **Word Count:** ~300

### Key Passages

The airfield at St. Trond is a sea of mud. The bombers sit in it, covered with it, and the crews track it everywhere they go. This is not the clean, romantic war of aviation recruiting posters.

I watched a crew prepare for a mission to Germany. They moved with the mechanical precision of men who've done this many times before. No bravado, no dramatic speeches. Just quiet professionalism and perhaps a suppressed awareness of what the odds are beginning to look like.

The briefing was short. Weather bad. Flak expected to be heavy. Target: rail yards. Questions? No questions. Then the wait for the weather to clear enough to take off.

One pilot told me they'd lost a quarter of their squadron in the past month. He said it matter-of-factly, as though reporting the price of bread. That's what happens when you live with this every day -- death becomes a statistic, survival becomes luck.

### Style Analysis

- **Opening image:** "sea of mud" -- grounds the Air Force literally in mud, destroys romantic aviation myth.
- **Reality check:** "This is not the clean, romantic war" -- direct refutation of propaganda, classic Murrow truth-telling.
- **Professional observation:** "mechanical precision... quiet professionalism" -- war as job, not adventure.
- **"Suppressed awareness":** Psychological insight -- they know the odds but don't speak them.
- **Briefing structure:** Short sentences mimic briefing cadence. "Weather bad. Flak heavy. Target: rail yards."
- **Statistics as trauma:** "He said it matter-of-factly, as though reporting the price of bread" -- the horror is in the casualness.
- **Survival as luck:** Removes agency from survival -- you can't be good enough to survive, only lucky.

## Sample 24: September 1940 Rooftop (Extended Broadcast)

**Type:** Live rooftop broadcast | **Network:** CBS | **Period:** London Blitz

**Source:** Bill Downs CBS Archive | **Word Count:** ~600

### Transcript Text

I'm standing on a rooftop looking out over London. At the moment, everything is quiet. For reasons of national as well as personal security, I am unable to tell you the exact location from which I'm speaking. Off to my left, far away in the distance, I can see just that faint, red, angry snap of anti-aircraft bursts against the steel-blue sky. But the guns are so far away that it's impossible to hear them from this location.

About five minutes ago the guns in the immediate vicinity were working. I can look across just at the building not far away and see something that looks like a splash of white paint down the side. And I know from daylight observation that about a quarter of that building has disappeared, hit by a bomb the other night.

I was up here earlier this afternoon. And looking out over these housetops, looking all the way to the dome of St. Paul's, I saw many flags flying from staffs. No one ordered these people to put out the flags, they simply feel like flying the Union Jack above their roof. No one told them to do it, and no flag up there was white.

Earlier this evening, we heard a number of bombs go sliding and slithering across to fall several blocks away. Just overhead now, the bursts of the anti-aircraft fire. The searchlights now are feeling almost directly overhead. Now you'll hear two bursts a little nearer in a moment... There they are, that hard stony sound.

That was the explosion overhead, not the guns themselves. I should think in a few minutes there may be a bit of shrapnel around here.

### Style Analysis

- **Present tense throughout:** "I'm standing... I can see" -- creates real-time urgency and danger.
- **Security caveat:** "For reasons of national as well as personal security" -- formal acknowledgment of censorship requirements.
- **Color specification:** "faint, red, angry snap" -- three adjectives building to verb-as-noun. The snap itself is angry.
- **"Splash of white paint":** Bomb damage as art description -- makes destruction aesthetic, which is disturbing.
- **Flag observation:** "no flag up there was white" -- meaning they're all still fighting. Says everything by what flags are NOT.
- **Onomatopoeia:** "sliding and slithering" -- bombs become serpents, animate threat.
- **Breaking fourth wall:** "Now you'll hear two bursts... There they are" -- brings listener INTO the danger.
- **"That hard stony sound":** Auditory description that's simultaneously precise and poetic.
- **Personal danger acknowledgment:** "there may be a bit of shrapnel around here" -- British understatement for life-threatening situation.

## Sample 25: McCarthy Follow-Up Commentary (March 16, 1954)

**Type:** Television editorial | **Network:** CBS Television | **Program:** See It Now

**Source:** American Rhetoric / CBS Archives | **Word Count:** ~400

### Key Passages

We would like to report on the reaction to our program of March 9th concerning Senator McCarthy. And the first thing to report is that the reaction has been overwhelmingly favorable. The letters and telegrams run better than ten to one in approval. Many of you have written to thank us for undertaking the program. We are grateful for your support.

But we should like to say something about the nature of some of the criticism we have received. Several correspondents have accused us of "attacking" Senator McCarthy. We did no such thing. We used the Senator's own words, his own actions. We pointed out certain statements that appeared to us to be untrue, or misleading, or contradictory. That is not "attacking" -- that is reporting.

Others have written to say that we are "anti-anti-Communist," that we are "soft on Communism." This is the ultimate refuge of those who cannot defend McCarthy's methods. To oppose McCarthy is not to be pro-Communist. It is possible -- and indeed necessary -- to oppose both Communism and McCarthyism.

The test of a democracy is not whether we can suppress those who oppose us. The test is whether we can listen to those who oppose us, and answer them with facts and reason rather than with accusations of disloyalty.

We shall continue to report on this matter as circumstances warrant.

### Style Analysis

- **Results opening:** "overwhelmingly favorable... better than ten to one" -- leads with public support, preemptive defense.
- **Gratitude structure:** "We are grateful for your support" -- includes audience as allies in the fight.
- **Rebuttal technique:** Quotes criticism, then dismantles it. "We did no such thing" -- flat denial followed by evidence.
- **His own words:** "We used the Senator's own words" -- the method defended. McCarthy convicted himself.
- **False equivalence attack:** "anti-anti-Communist... soft on Communism" -- exposes McCarthy's logical trap.
- **Binary rejection:** "oppose both Communism and McCarthyism" -- refuses either/or framework McCarthy imposed.
- **Democracy definition:** "The test of a democracy..." -- Murrow as civics teacher, explaining basic principles.
- **Open-ended commitment:** "as circumstances warrant" -- signals this isn't over.
- **"We" throughout:** Plural pronoun shares credit/risk across entire See It Now team. Murrow as leader, not lone crusader.
